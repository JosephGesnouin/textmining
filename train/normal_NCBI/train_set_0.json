In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis of 10 APC exons (4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and part of 15) in 33 unrelated Dutch FAP patients has led to the identification of eight novel germ line mutations resulting in stop codons or frameshifts. The results reported here indicate that (1) familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of point mutations; (2) all the mutations found in this study are chain terminating; and (3) DGGE represents a rapid and sensitive technique for the detection of mutations in the unusually large APC gene. An extension of the DGGE analysis to the entire coding region in a sufficient number of clinically well-characterized, unrelated patients will facilitate the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations. On the other hand, the occurrence of an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of mutations spread throughout the entire length of the large APC gene among the FAP patients indicates that this approach may not be useful as a rapid presymptomatic diagnostic procedure in a routine laboratory. Nevertheless, the above DGGE approach has incidentally led to the identification of a common polymorphism in exon 13.

The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains, the N-terminal subdomain (NTS) and the C-terminal subdomain (CTS), which bind respective consensus DNA sequences. The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain. The insertion, into the NTS, of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS. Thus, exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes.

In vitro, activated lymphocytes from all 17 patients showed apoptotic defects when exposed to an anti-Fas agonist monoclonal antibody. Similar defects were found in a Fas-negative cell line transfected with cDNAs bearing each of the mutations. In cotransfection experiments, Fas constructs with either intra- or extracellular mutations caused dominant inhibition of apoptosis mediated by wild-type Fas. Two missense Fas variants, not restricted to patients with ALPS, were identified. Variant A (-1) T at the Fas signal-sequence cleavage site, which mediates apoptosis less well than wild-type Fas and is partially inhibitory, was present in 13% of African American alleles. Among the ALPS-associated Fas mutants, dominant inhibition of apoptosis was much more pronounced in mutants affecting the intracellular, versus extracellular, portion of the Fas receptor. Mutations causing disruption of the intracellular Fas death domain also showed a higher penetrance of ALPS phenotype features in mutation-bearing relatives. Significant ALPS-related morbidity occurred in 44% of relatives with intracellular mutations, versus 0% of relatives with extracellular mutations.

All available members were clinically assessed and genotyped for 19 short tandem repeat markers on chromosome 1 in the VWS candidate gene region. We performed two-point and multipoint limit of detection (LOD) score analyses using a high penetrance autosomal dominant model. All families showed positive LOD scores without any recombination in the candidate region. The largest two-point LOD score was 5. 87 87. Our assay method for short tandem repeat (STR) markers provided highly accurate size estimation of marker allele fragment sizes, and therefore enabled us to determine the specific alleles segregating with the VWS gene in each of our four families. We observed a striking pattern of STR allele sharing at several closely linked loci among our four Caucasian VWS families recruited at three different locations in the US.

Two patients were homozygous for a G-to-A change at the 5-splice donor site of the intron 14. The G-to-A change would cause impaired splicing of pre-messenger RNA. The other two probands were heterozygous for the mutation, but totally lacked CETP. Their lipoprotein patterns were also similar to those of the two homozygotes. Thus, other genetic defects or metabolic factors influencing CETP expression are implicated. The data suggest that the G-to-A mutation may be common in human plasma CETP deficiency.

These results suggest that some novel mutations should exist on one of the alleles in some unknown region of the GCH1 gene, and may decrease the GCH1 mRNA causing the HPD/DRD symptoms.. \n", {"entities": [[65, 68, "GENE"], [860, 863, "GENE"], [188, 192, "GENE"], [247, 251, "GENE"], [466, 470, "GENE"], [586, 590, "GENE"], [806, 810, "GENE"], [838, 842, "GENE"], [188, 192, "GENE"], [247, 251, "GENE"], [466, 470, "GENE"], [586, 590, "GENE"], [806, 810, "GENE"], [838, 842, "GENE"], [188, 192, "GENE"], [247, 251, "GENE"], [466, 470, "GENE"], [586, 590, "GENE"], [806, 810, "GENE"], [838, 842, "GENE"], [188, 192, "GENE"], [247, 251, "GENE"], [466, 470, "GENE"], [586, 590, "GENE"], [806, 810, "GENE"], [838, 842, "GENE"], [188, 192, "GENE"], [247, 251, "GENE"], [466, 470, "GENE"], [586, 590, "GENE"], [806, 810, "GENE"], [838, 842, "GENE"], [188, 192, "GENE"], [247, 251, "GENE"], [466, 470, "GENE"], [586, 590, "GENE"], [806, 810, "GENE"], [838, 842, "GENE"], [89, 120, "DISEASE"], [154, 185, "DISEASE"], [219, 222, "DISEASE"], [224, 248, "DISEASE"], [250, 253, "DISEASE"], [298, 312, "DISEASE"], [1014, 1017, "DISEASE"], [1018, 1021, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Intake of omega 3 fatty acids was associated with a higher FEV 1 (RC for highest vs. lowest quintile 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15 L; p per trend 0.02) and with FVC 0.08 (RC in highest vs. lowest quintile of intake 0.08, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.16; p per trend 0.04).", {"entities": [[59, 62, "GENE"]]}], ["Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections, and caused by mutations in the WAS protein (WASP) gene.

DNA of affected males and obligate carriers was PCR amplified and analyzed by SSCA, heteroduplex analysis, and direct sequencing. The effects of the mutations at the mRNA and protein level were ascertained by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. All missense mutations were located in exons 1-4. Most of the nonsense, frameshift and splice site mutations were found in exons 6-11. Mutations that alter splice sites led to the synthesis of several types of mRNAs, a fraction of which represented the normally spliced product. The presence of normally spliced transcripts was correlated with a milder phenotype. When one such case was studied by Western blotting, reduced amounts of normal-size WASP were present. In other cases as well, a correlation was found between the amount of normal or mutant WASP present and the phenotypes of the affected individuals. No protein was detected in two individuals with severe WAS. Reduced levels of a normal-size WASP with a missense mutation were seen in two individuals with XLT.

Using two-point linkage analysis, linkage was established between XAI and several of these markers in two families, with a combined lod score of 6. 05 for DXS16 at theta = 0. 04 04. This supports the involvement of AMELX, located close to DXS16, in the XAI disease process (AIH1) in those families.

The support interval around this location extended about 8 cM proximal to DXS92, and the AIH1 location could not be precisely defined by multipoint mapping. Study of recombination events indicated that AIH1 lies in the interval between DXS143 and DXS85. There was significant evidence against linkage to this region in the third family, indicating locus heterogeneity in XAI. Further analysis with markers on the long arm of the X chromosome showed evidence of linkage to DXS144E and F9 with no recombination with either of these markers. Two-point analysis gave a peak lod score at DXS144E with a maximum lod score of 2. 83 at theta = 0, with a peak lod score in multipoint linkage analysis of 2. 84 at theta = 0.

We therefore determined APOE genotype and normal CAG repeat length in the HD gene for 138 HD patients who were previously analysed with respect to CAG repeat length. Genotyping for APOE was performed blind to clinical information. In addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon AO in maternally inherited HD and in male patients, we show that the APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier AO in males than in females.

To date we have identified 65 missense mutations in the GALNS gene from MPS IVA patients, but the correlation between genotype and phenotype has remained unclear. We studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches and 32 missense mutations, using structural analyses. Fifteen missense mutations and two newly engineered active site mutations (C79S, C79T) were characterized by transient expression analysis. Mutant proteins, except for C79S and C79T, were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms while the C79S and C79T mutants were of a soluble mature size. Mutants found in the severe phenotype had no activity. Mutants found in the mild phenotype had a considerable residual activity (1. 3-13. 3% of wild-type GALNS activity). Sulfatases, including GALNS, are members of a highly conserved gene family sharing an extensive sequence homology. Thus, a tertiary structural model of human GALNS was constructed from the X-ray crystal structure of N -acetylgalacto-samine-4-sulfatase and arylsulfatase A, using homology modeling, and 32 missense mutations were investigated. Consequently, we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe phenotype  (i) destruction of the hydrophobic core or modification of the packing; (ii) removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire conformation; (iii) modification of the active site. In contrast, mild mutations were mostly located on the surface of the GALNS protein. These studies shed further light on the genotype-phenotype correlation of MPS IVA and structure-function relationship in the sulfatase family.\n", {"entities": [[151, 156, "GENE"], [249, 254, "GENE"], [932, 937, "GENE"], [971, 976, "GENE"], [1107, 1112, "GENE"], [1642, 1647, "GENE"], [151, 156, "GENE"], [249, 254, "GENE"], [932, 937, "GENE"], [971, 976, "GENE"], [1107, 1112, "GENE"], [1642, 1647, "GENE"], [151, 156, "GENE"], [249, 254, "GENE"], [932, 937, "GENE"], [971, 976, "GENE"], [1107, 1112, "GENE"], [1642, 1647, "GENE"], [151, 156, "GENE"], [249, 254, "GENE"], [932, 937, "GENE"], [971, 976, "GENE"], [1107, 1112, "GENE"], [1642, 1647, "GENE"], [151, 156, "GENE"], [249, 254, "GENE"], [932, 937, "GENE"], [971, 976, "GENE"], [1107, 1112, "GENE"], [1642, 1647, "GENE"], [151, 156, "GENE"], [249, 254, "GENE"], [932, 937, "GENE"], [971, 976, "GENE"], [1107, 1112, "GENE"], [1642, 1647, "GENE"], [111, 136, "DISEASE"], [149, 174, "DISEASE"], [176, 183, "DISEASE"], [203, 229, "DISEASE"], [242, 298, "DISEASE"], [414, 421, "DISEASE"], [1880, 1887, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The serum of a 29-year old woman with a recent episode of disseminated gonococcal infection and a history of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child was found to lack serum hemolytic complement activity.

In the present study, we report the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a method to detect and characterize VHL germline deletions. We reexamined a group of VHL patients shown previously by single-strand conformation and sequencing analysis not to harbor point mutations in the VHL locus. We found constitutional deletions in 29 of 30 VHL patients in this group using cosmid and P1 probes that cover the VHL locus. We then tested six phenotypically normal offspring from four of these VHL families  two were found to carry the deletion and the other four were deletion-free. In addition, germline mosaicism of the VHL gene was identified in one family. In sum, FISH was found to be a simple and reliable method to detect VHL germline deletions and practically useful in cases where other methods of screening have failed to detect a VHL gene abnormality

involved in a wide variety of human solid tumors including Ewing sarcoma, related primitive neuroectodermal tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors. In these tumors, the EWS is fused to genes encoding transcriptional activators/repressors, like Fli-1 or erg or ATF 1 or wt1. To better understand the function of the EWS protein, we cloned the EWS cDNA. Sequence analysis of this cDNA revealed differential splicing involving two exons encoding 72 amino acids. Both alternatively spliced transcripts, EWS and EWS-b, are expressed in a variety of cells. Because EWS proteins contain putative conserved RNA binding motifs, we studied the RNA binding properties of the EWS protein. The EWS-b protein binds to RNA in vitro and, specifically, to poly G and poly U. The RNA binding activity was localized to the carboxy terminal 86 amino acids, which constitute RGG box. Thus the amino terminal domain of EWS (NTD-EWS), which is involved in chromosome translocation may regulate the specificity of RNA binding activity of EWS. An EWS-erg chimeric protein, which is found in Ewings sarcoma cells, functions as a transcriptional activator. Mutational analysis of EWS-erg chimeric protein revealed that NTD-EWS functions as a regulatory domain for the transcriptional activation properties of EWS-erg chimeric protein.. \n", {"entities": [[376, 379, "GENE"], [26, 48, "DISEASE"], [50, 82, "DISEASE"], [87, 123, "DISEASE"], [289, 301, "DISEASE"], [312, 325, "DISEASE"], [345, 367, "DISEASE"], [369, 401, "DISEASE"], [406, 442, "DISEASE"], [453, 459, "DISEASE"], [1362, 1376, "DISEASE"]]}], ["CONTEXT  Most hereditary ovarian cancers are associated with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Attempts to define the clinical significance of BRCA mutation status in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results, especially regarding survival. OBJECTIVE  To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic (nonhereditary) ovarian cancers. DESIGN AND SETTING  Retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at our institution, which is a comprehensive cancer center as designated by the National Cancer Institute, over a 12-year period (December 1986 to August 1998). PATIENTS  The study was restricted to patients of Jewish origin because of the ease of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping in this ethnic group. From the 189 patients who identified themselves as Jewish, 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a BRCA mutation and 2 additional groups (Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 52 and 111) with ovarian cancer from clinical trials (for the survival analysis) were included for comparison. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Age at diagnosis, surgical stage, histologic cell type and grade, and surgical outcome; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced-stage (II and IV) cases. RESULTS  Hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years, with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for BRCA1- vs BRCA2-linked patients (54 vs 62 years; P =. 04). Histology, grade, stage, and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases. The hereditary group had a longer disease-free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group, with a median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months, respectively (P <. 001). Those with hereditary cancers had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group (P =. 004). For stage III cancers, BRCA mutation status was an independent prognostic variable (P =. 03). CONCLUSIONS  Although BRCA-associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic cancers, advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer than nonhereditary cancer patients. Age penetrance is greater for BRCA1-linked than for BRCA2-linked cancers in this population.\n", {"entities": [[83, 88, "GENE"], [780, 785, "GENE"], [976, 981, "GENE"], [1602, 1607, "GENE"], [2475, 2480, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [985, 990, "GENE"], [1612, 1617, "GENE"], [2497, 2502, "GENE"], [83, 88, "GENE"], [780, 785, "GENE"], [976, 981, "GENE"], [1602, 1607, "GENE"], [2475, 2480, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [985, 990, "GENE"], [1612, 1617, "GENE"], [2497, 2502, "GENE"], [83, 88, "GENE"], [780, 785, "GENE"], [976, 981, "GENE"], [1602, 1607, "GENE"], [2475, 2480, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [985, 990, "GENE"], [1612, 1617, "GENE"], [2497, 2502, "GENE"], [85, 111, "DISEASE"], [242, 256, "DISEASE"], [355, 381, "DISEASE"], [445, 485, "DISEASE"], [565, 580, "DISEASE"], [648, 654, "DISEASE"], [692, 698, "DISEASE"], [1223, 1237, "DISEASE"], [1517, 1535, "DISEASE"], [2069, 2087, "DISEASE"], [2164, 2181, "DISEASE"], [2276, 2318, "DISEASE"], [2405, 2421, "DISEASE"], [2423, 2455, "DISEASE"], [2485, 2505, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Norrie disease is a human X-linked recessive disorder of unknown etiology characterized by congenital blindness, sensory neural deafness and mental retardation.

To identify additional imprinted genes that could contribute to the PWS phenotype and to understand the regional control of imprinting in 15q11-q13, we have constructed an imprinted transcript map of the PWS-AS deletion interval. The imprinting status of 22 expressed sequence tags derived from the radiation-hybrid human transcript maps or physical maps was determined in a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay and correlated with the position of the transcripts on the physical map. Seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize to an approximately 1. 5-Mb domain surrounding the SNRPN-associated imprinting center, which already includes four imprinted, paternally expressed genes. All other tested new transcripts in the deletion region were expressed from both alleles. A domain of exclusive paternal expression surrounding the imprinting center suggests strong regional control of the imprinting process.

Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results. Therefore, to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment, we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts. By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3-UTR, we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation. Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3-UTR, with as few as 57 CTGs, had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci. We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded (CTG) (n) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects. Furthermore, in contrast to the normal DMPK 3-UTR mRNA, a mutant DMPK 3-UTR mRNA with (CUG) (200) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Genetic analysis and the Cre- loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3-UTR transcript. Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the (CTG) (n) expansion and/or the 3 end of the DMPK 3-UTR.

A molecular study using standard methods showed G6PD in the patient to have normal electrophoretic mobility (at pH 7. 0, 8. 0 and 8. 8), normal apparent affinity for substrates (Km, G6P and NADP) and a slightly abnormal utilization of substrate analogues (decreased deamino-NADP and increased 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate utilization). Heat stability was found to be markedly decreased (8% of residual activity after 20 min of incubation at 46 degrees C) and a particular characteristic of this enzyme was a biphasic pH curve with a greatly increased activity at low pH. Although molecular characteristics of this variant closely resemble those of G6PD Bangkok and G6PD Duarte, it can be distinguished from these and all other previously reported variants by virtue of its unusual pH curve. Therefore the present variant has been designated G6PD Clinic to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described \n", {"entities": [[41, 45, "GENE"], [80, 84, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [1114, 1118, "GENE"], [1131, 1135, "GENE"], [1307, 1311, "GENE"], [1348, 1352, "GENE"], [41, 45, "GENE"], [80, 84, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [1114, 1118, "GENE"], [1131, 1135, "GENE"], [1307, 1311, "GENE"], [1348, 1352, "GENE"], [246, 249, "GENE"], [41, 45, "GENE"], [80, 84, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [1114, 1118, "GENE"], [1131, 1135, "GENE"], [1307, 1311, "GENE"], [1348, 1352, "GENE"], [41, 45, "GENE"], [80, 84, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [1114, 1118, "GENE"], [1131, 1135, "GENE"], [1307, 1311, "GENE"], [1348, 1352, "GENE"], [41, 45, "GENE"], [80, 84, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [1114, 1118, "GENE"], [1131, 1135, "GENE"], [1307, 1311, "GENE"], [1348, 1352, "GENE"], [41, 45, "GENE"], [80, 84, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [1114, 1118, "GENE"], [1131, 1135, "GENE"], [1307, 1311, "GENE"], [1348, 1352, "GENE"], [41, 45, "GENE"], [80, 84, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [1114, 1118, "GENE"], [1131, 1135, "GENE"], [1307, 1311, "GENE"], [1348, 1352, "GENE"], [0, 39, "DISEASE"], [41, 46, "DISEASE"], [52, 103, "DISEASE"], [122, 157, "DISEASE"], [159, 162, "DISEASE"], [312, 340, "DISEASE"], [402, 441, "DISEASE"], [443, 448, "DISEASE"], [454, 489, "DISEASE"], [491, 494, "DISEASE"], [497, 514, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Fragments of the adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) cDNA from a patient with adolescent ALD were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned.

Immunofluorescent visualization of dystrophin revealed foci of dystrophin-positive fibers adjacent to foci of dystrophin-negative fibers. These data indicate that the affected twin is a manifesting carrier of an abnormal DMD gene, her myopathy being a direct result of underexpression of dystrophin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotypes, eliminating the possibility of a translocation affecting DMD gene function. Both linkage analysis and DNA fingerprint analysis revealed that each twin has two different X chromosomes, eliminating the possibility of uniparental disomy as a mechanism for DMD expression.

METHODS  We discovered a mutation caused by a C-- > T transition at base-pair 1158 of the GALT gene that results in a serine-to-leucine substitution at codon 135 (S135L). We developed a method with which to screen populations for its prevalence. We compared galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase among erythrocytes, leukocytes, and transformed lymphoblasts, as well as total body oxidation of D- (13C) -galactose to 13CO2 among three genotypes for GALT (S135L/S135L, Q188R/Q188R, and Normal/Normal). RESULTS  We found a 48% prevalence of the S135L mutation among 17 black American patients with classic galactosemia and a 1% prevalence in a population of 50 black Americans without galactosemia. The S135L mutation was not found in 84 white patients with G/G galactosemia nor in 87 white control subjects without galactosemia. We found normal whole body oxidation of D- (13C) -galactose by the patient homozygous for S135L and various degrees of enzyme impairment among different tissues. CONCLUSIONS  The S135L mutation in the GALT gene is a prevalent cause of galactosemia among black patients.

Recently, a missense mutation was identified in human ASPA coding sequence from patients with Canavan disease. The human ASPA gene has been cloned and found to span 29 kb of the genome. Human aspartoacylase is coded by six exons intervened by five introns. The exons vary from 94 (exon III) to 514 (exon VI) bases. The exon/intron splice junction sites follow the gt/ag consensus sequence rule. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines localized ASPA to human chromosome 17. The human ASPA locus was further mapped in the 17p13-ter region by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The bovine aspa gene has also been cloned, and its exon/intron organization is identical to that of the human gene. The 500-base sequence upstream of the initiator ATG codon in the human gene and that in the bovine gene are 77% identical. Human ASPA coding sequences cross-hybridize with genomic DNA from yeast, chicken, rabbit, cow, dog, mouse, rat, and monkey. The specificity of cross-species hybridization of coding sequences suggests that aspartoacylase has been conserved during evolution.

Its membrane expression is highly regulated by endocytosis and trafficking through the secretory lysosome pathway. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, LYST. It results in defective membrane targeting of the proteins present in secretory lysosomes, and it is associated with a variety of features, including a lymphoproliferative syndrome with hemophagocytosis. The murine equivalent of CHS, beige mice, present similar characteristics but do not develop the lymphoproliferative syndrome. We show herein that CTLA-4 is present in enlarged, abnormal vesicles in CHS T cells and is not properly expressed at the cell surface after T cell activation, whereas its surface expression is not impaired. It is therefore proposed that the defective surface expression of CTLA-4 by CHS T cells is involved in the generation of lymphoproliferative disease.

The deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 52 amino acids. Gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant PAH cDNA indicated that the deletion abolishes PAH activity in the cell as a result of protein instability.

Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in some families. However, little is known about the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to breast cancer in the general population. We analyzed DNA samples from women enrolled in a population-based study of early-onset breast cancer to assess the spectrum and frequency of germ-line BRCA1 mutations in young women with breast cancer. METHODS. We studied 80 women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35, and who were not selected on the basis of family history. Genomic DNA was studied for BRCA1 mutations by analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms and with allele-specific assays. Alterations were defined by DNA sequencing. RESULTS. Germ-line BRCA1 mutations were identified in 6 of the 80 women. Four additional rare sequence variants of unknown functional importance were also identified. Two of the mutations and three of the rare sequence variants were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. None of the mutations and only one of the rare variants was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects. CONCLUSIONS. Alterations in BRCA1 were identified in approximately 10 percent of this cohort of young women with breast cancer. The risk of harboring a mutation was not limited to women with family histories of breast or ovarian cancer. These results represent a minimal estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 mutations in this population. Comprehensive methods of identifying BRCA1 mutations and understanding their importance will be needed before testing of women in the general population can be undertaken.. \n", {"entities": [[39, 44, "GENE"], [180, 185, "GENE"], [391, 396, "GENE"], [615, 620, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [1240, 1245, "GENE"], [1512, 1517, "GENE"], [1585, 1590, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [180, 185, "GENE"], [391, 396, "GENE"], [615, 620, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [1240, 1245, "GENE"], [1512, 1517, "GENE"], [1585, 1590, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [180, 185, "GENE"], [391, 396, "GENE"], [615, 620, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [1240, 1245, "GENE"], [1512, 1517, "GENE"], [1585, 1590, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [180, 185, "GENE"], [391, 396, "GENE"], [615, 620, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [1240, 1245, "GENE"], [1512, 1517, "GENE"], [1585, 1590, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [180, 185, "GENE"], [391, 396, "GENE"], [615, 620, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [1240, 1245, "GENE"], [1512, 1517, "GENE"], [1585, 1590, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [180, 185, "GENE"], [391, 396, "GENE"], [615, 620, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [1240, 1245, "GENE"], [1512, 1517, "GENE"], [1585, 1590, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [180, 185, "GENE"], [391, 396, "GENE"], [615, 620, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [1240, 1245, "GENE"], [1512, 1517, "GENE"], [1585, 1590, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [180, 185, "GENE"], [391, 396, "GENE"], [615, 620, "GENE"], [790, 795, "GENE"], [1240, 1245, "GENE"], [1512, 1517, "GENE"], [1585, 1590, "GENE"], [65, 78, "DISEASE"], [279, 292, "DISEASE"], [407, 420, "DISEASE"], [507, 520, "DISEASE"], [559, 572, "DISEASE"], [1405, 1418, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) has been analyzed by gel electrophoresis and by quantitative assay in an unselected sample of 1524 schoolboys from the province of Matera (Lucania) in southern Italy.

The overall rate of G6PD deficiency was 2. 6%. The frequency of G6PD deficiency, ranging from 7. 2% on the Ionian Coast to zero on the eastern side of the Lucanian Apennines, appears to be inversely related to the distance of each town examined from the Ionian Coast, suggesting that this geographic distribution may reflect, at least in part, gene flow from Greek settlers. Biochemical characterization has shown that most of the G6PD deficiency in this population is accounted for by G6PD Mediterranean. In addition, we have found several examples of two other known polymorphic variants (G6PD Cagliari and G6PD A-); three new polymorphic variants, G6PD Metaponto (class III), G6PD Montalbano (class III), and G6PD Pisticci (class IV); and two sporadic variants, G6PD Tursi (class III) and G6PD Ferrandina (class II).

MAGEL2 is expressed predominantly in brain, the primary tissue affected in PWS and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis. MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain, and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS-affected individual. The orthologous mouse gene (Magel2) is located within 150 kb of NDN , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting, RT-PCR and whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of NDN , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization.

METHODS  An alteration in CYP27 of the proband was searched for by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and subsequent sequencing. Samples of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and the product of the proband was amplified with nested primers and sequenced. RESULTS  A homozygous G to A transition at the 5 end of intron 7 was detected in the patient. In RT-PCR analysis, only a truncated transcript was detected in the patient, whereas both normal and truncated transcripts were detected in the siblings. The sequencing of the patients cDNA fragment disclosed a direct conjuction of exon 6 and exon 8.

Strikingly, presence of the protein can also be demonstrated for NMJs of muscular tissues of adult and congenital cases of DM, with no gross changes in structural organisation.

Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia (triggered by fava beans or other agents) or life-long hemolytic anemia. We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene. From the alignment of the amino acid (aa) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) species from 42 different organisms, we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD  two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved (50-99%) aa; relatively few are in fully conserved aa (where they might be lethal) or in poorly conserved aa, where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency. This is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development. Comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein.

A subset of germline APC mutations results in an attenuated FAP (AFAP) phenotype, in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age. Although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of APC germline mutations and the development of AFAP has been well documented, the mechanism for AFAP has not been well defined. We investigated the mechanism for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele (APC (AS9)) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9. APC (AS9) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription, the major tumor-suppressor function of APC, as did the wild-type APC. Mutation analysis showed that both APC (AS9) and the wild-type APC alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients. Functional analysis showed that 4666insA, a common somatic mutation in APC (AS9) in these tumors, did not inactivate the wild-type APC. Our results indicate that carriers of APC (AS9) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis.

Both sera were severely impaired in their ability to generate chemotactic activity for normal human neutrophils upon incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin or Escherichia coli endotoxin. This function was fully restored in the siblings serum, and substantially improved in the probands serum, by addition of highly purified human C5 to normal serum concentrations. Sera from eight family members who were apparently heterozygous for C5 deficiency gave normal chemotactic scores. The ability of C5D serum to opsonize Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers yeast) or Candida albicans for ingestion by normal neutrophils was completely normal. In addition, C5D serum was capable of promoting normal phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus. The probands serum was incapable of mediating lysis of erythrocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in both the sucrose hemolysia and acid hemolysis tests, and also lacked bactericidal activity against sensitized or unsensitized Salmonella typhi.

To assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the HFE gene, we conducted a population-based study in Busselton, Australia. In 1994, we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels) in 3011 unrelated white adults. We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values (45 percent or higher) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher. The subjects were followed for up to four years. RESULTS  Sixteen of the subjects (0. 5 percent) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and 424 (14. 1 percent) were heterozygous. The serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous; in 1 subject it was 43 percent. Four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of hemochromatosis, and 12 had not. Seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998, and 1 had a decrease, although the value remained elevated. The serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range. Eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy; 3 had hepatic fibrosis, and 1, who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption, had cirrhosis and mild microvesicular steatosis. Eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis, such as hepatomegaly, skin pigmentation, and arthritis. CONCLUSIONS  In a population of white adults of northern European ancestry, 0. 5 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene.

Mutations in the gene that encodes type II collagen (COL2A1), the predominant protein of cartilage, have been identified in a number of individuals with Kniest dysplasia. All but two of these previously described mutations cause in-frame deletions in type II collagen, either by small deletions in the gene or splice site alterations. Furthermore, all but one of these mutations is located between exons 12 and 24 in the COL2A1 gene. We used heteroduplex analysis to identify sequence anomalies in five individuals with Kniest dysplasia. Sequencing of the index patients genomic DNA identified four new dominant mutations in COL2A1 that result in Kniest dysplasia  a 21-bp deletion in exon 16, an 18-bp deletion in exon 19, and 4-bp deletions in the splice donor sites of introns 14 and 20. A previously described 28-bp deletion at the COL2A1 exon 12-intron 12 junction, deleting the splice donor site, was identified in the fifth case. The latter three mutations are predicted to result in exon skipping in the mRNA encoded from the mutant allele.

Pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate-anion transporter (encoded by Sat-1; 29% amino acid sequence identity), the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter (encoded by DTD; 32%) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in adenoma (encoded by DRA; 45%).

This mutation is at a CpG site in a Japanese infant with Tay-Sachs disease and was described elsewhere.

Using a HeLa cell line in which the expression of HFE is controlled by tetracycline, we show that the expression of HFE reduces 55Fe uptake from Tf by 33% but does not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates of TfR cycling. Therefore, HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from Tf within endocytic compartments. HFE specifically reduces iron uptake from Tf, as non-Tf-mediated iron uptake from Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered. These results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our HeLa cell system and demonstrate the specific control of HFE over the Tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake. These results also have implications for the understanding of cellular iron homeostasis in organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and spleen that are iron loaded in hereditary hemochromatotic individuals lacking functional HFE.\n", {"entities": [[0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [741, 743, "GENE"], [1136, 1138, "GENE"], [1337, 1339, "GENE"], [1482, 1484, "GENE"], [1558, 1560, "GENE"], [1569, 1571, "GENE"], [1773, 1775, "GENE"], [1024, 1028, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [741, 743, "GENE"], [1136, 1138, "GENE"], [1337, 1339, "GENE"], [1482, 1484, "GENE"], [1558, 1560, "GENE"], [1569, 1571, "GENE"], [1773, 1775, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [741, 743, "GENE"], [1136, 1138, "GENE"], [1337, 1339, "GENE"], [1482, 1484, "GENE"], [1558, 1560, "GENE"], [1569, 1571, "GENE"], [1773, 1775, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [741, 743, "GENE"], [1136, 1138, "GENE"], [1337, 1339, "GENE"], [1482, 1484, "GENE"], [1558, 1560, "GENE"], [1569, 1571, "GENE"], [1773, 1775, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [641, 644, "GENE"], [1070, 1073, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [1308, 1311, "GENE"], [1426, 1429, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1760, 1763, "GENE"], [2036, 2039, "GENE"], [4, 30, "DISEASE"], [170, 197, "DISEASE"], [198, 224, "DISEASE"], [2094, 2120, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in RBCs was found significantly more frequently in 210 male cataractous patients than in 672 control subjects of Sardinian origin.

Allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis using amplified genomic DNA showed that the mutant gene was transmitted from the maternal germ line.

Missense mutations in human HPRT deficient patients thus far reported tend to accumulate in this functionally active region. However, a comparison of the data suggested that both missense and synonymous mutations can occur at any coding sequence of the human germ line HPRT gene, but that a limited percentage of all the missense mutations cause disease.

The plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to other lipoproteins. We recently described a Japanese family with increased HDL levels and CETP deficiency due to a splicing defect of the CETP gene. To assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition, we screened 11 additional families with high HDL levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for CETP and DNA analysis. RESULTS. We found the same CETP gene mutation in four families from three different regions of Japan. Analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant CETP allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype. Family members homozygous for CETP deficiency (n = 10) had moderate hypercholesterolemia (mean total cholesterol level [+/- SD], 7. 01 +/- 0. 83 mmol per liter), markedly increased levels of HDL cholesterol (4. 24 +/- 1. 01 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein A-I, and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1. 99 +/- 0. 80 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein B. Members heterozygous for the deficiency (n = 20), whose CETP levels were in the lower part of the normal range, had moderately increased levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and an increased ratio of HDL subclass 2 to HDL subclass 3, as compared with unaffected family members (1. 5 +/- 0. 8 vs. 0. 7 +/- 0. 4). CETP deficiency was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated HDL cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the United States. CONCLUSIONS. CETP deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased HDL levels in the population of Japan, possibly because of a founder effect. The results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that CETP normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of HDL subclass 2. There was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with CETP deficiency. In fact, the lipoprotein profile of persons with CETP deficiency is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span.  \n", {"entities": [[71, 75, "GENE"], [251, 255,

We have undertaken a systematic evaluation of DMD/BMD patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man.

Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260. Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b-wave phenotype is the mutation position, rather than muscle disease severity. Forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs, as opposed to 94% with more distal mutations.

Expressivity of 185delAG in these families varied, from early-onset breast cancer without ovarian cancer. Mutation 4184delTCAA occurred independently in two families.

Using an interspecific mouse domesticus/spretus cross, segregating for a variety of markers on the mouse X chromosome, we have positioned on the mouse X chromosome sequences homologous to a DMD cDNA clone.

Since the newly created donor splice site is likely to compete with the normal one, variations of the levels of normal and aberrant transcripts of the PDS gene in the cochlea may explain the variability in the deafness presentation.. \n", {"entities": [[28, 31, "DISEASE"], [81, 89, "DISEASE"], [93, 109, "DISEASE"], [111, 127, "DISEASE"], [133, 161, "DISEASE"], [179, 221, "DISEASE"], [223, 249, "DISEASE"], [255, 282, "DISEASE"], [284, 290, "DISEASE"], [345, 364, "DISEASE"], [384, 387, "DISEASE"], [536, 539, "DISEASE"], [611, 619, "DISEASE"], [687, 695, "DISEASE"], [765, 768, "DISEASE"], [1162, 1165, "DISEASE"], [1221, 1229, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Permission and assistance from the guardian or parent was sought for those below 18\u00a0years of age.", {"entities": []}], ["X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a relatively rare benign neuromuscular disorder which can vary remarkably in onset, course and severity.

The gene for EDMD on Xq28 encodes a novel protein named emerin that localizes at the nuclear membrane of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles and some other non-muscle tissues. To investigate a possible physiological role for emerin, we examined the ultrastructural localization of the protein in human skeletal muscle and HeLa cells, using ultrathin cryosections. We found that the immune-labeled colloidal gold particles were localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane, but not on the nuclear pore. Emerin stayed on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear lamina, even after detergent treatment that solubilizes membrane lipids and washes out membrane proteins. These results suggest that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the hydrophobic stretch, and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the nucleoplasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina.

Clinical anticipation, defined as the cascade of mild, adult, childhood, or congenital disease in subsequent generations, appeared to be a relentless process, occurring in all affected branches of the family. The cascade was found to proceed asynchronously in the different branches, mainly because of an unequal number of generations with mild disease. The transition from the mild to the adult type was associated with transmission through a male parent. Stable transmission of the asymptomatic/mild phenotype showed a female transmission bias. We further examined the extent and causes of gene loss in this pedigree. Gene loss in the patient group was complete, owing to infertility of the male patients with adult onset disease and the fact that mentally retarded patients did not procreate. Out of the 46 at risk subjects in the two youngest generations, only one was found to have a full mutation. This is the only subject who may transmit the gene to the sixth generation. No protomutation carriers were found in the fourth and fifth generations. Therefore it is highly probable that the DM gene will be eliminated from this pedigree within one generation.

Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA. These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals. The functional mechanism of frataxin, however, is still unknown. We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p (mYfh1p) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro. Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer (13, 783 Da) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1. 1 MDa (megadaltons) and a diameter of 13 +/-2 nm. Each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester > 3, 000 atoms of iron. Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly. Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer, indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form. In yeast mitochondria, native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight > 600, 000. After addition of (55) Fe to the medium, immunoprecipitates of this species contain > 16 atoms of (55) Fe per molecule of mYfh1p.

We describe here a Pelizaeus-Merzbacher pedigree of the classical type, with X-linked inheritance, a typical clinical progression, and a pathologic loss of myelinating cells and myelin in the central nervous system.

The PLP gene in one of two affected males and the carrier mother of this family exhibited a single base difference in the more than 2 kb of the PLP gene sequenced, a C----T transition that would create a serine substitution for proline at the carboxy end of the protein. Our results delineate the clinical features of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, define the possible molecular pathology of this dysmyelinating disorder, and address the molecular classification of inborn errors of myelin metabolism.

The other variants (types III-VI), which have sometimes been categorized as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, may represent mutations in genes encoding other structural myelin proteins or proteins critical to myelination.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 28, "DISEASE"], [33, 82, "DISEASE"], [167, 201, "DISEASE"], [276, 304, "DISEASE"], [331, 351, "DISEASE"], [372, 389, "DISEASE"], [496, 516, "DISEASE"], [721, 749, "DISEASE"], [1297, 1325, "DISEASE"], [1375, 1398, "DISEASE"], [1444, 1478, "DISEASE"], [1574, 1612, "DISEASE"], [1746, 1774, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Increased oxidative stress has an important role in asthmatic airway inflammation and remodeling.", {"entities": []}], ["Huntington disease (HD) has been shown to be associated with an expanded CAG repeat within a novel gene on 4p16. 3 (IT15).

An auxiliary beta (1) -subunit, widely expressed in excitable tissues, shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle Na (+) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform. Here, we characterize the altered effects of a human beta (1) -subunit (hbeta (1)) on the heterologously expressed hH1 mutation (T1620M) previously associated with IVF. METHODS AND RESULTS  When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes, T1620M exhibited no persistent currents, in contrast to the LQT3 mutant channels, but the midpoint of steady-state inactivation (V (1/2)) was significantly shifted toward more positive potentials than for wild-type hH1. Coexpression of hbeta (1) did not significantly alter current decay or recovery from inactivation of wild-type hH1; however, it further shifted the V (1/2) and accelerated the recovery from inactivation of T1620M. Oocyte macropatch analysis revealed that the activation kinetics of T1620M were normal. CONCLUSIONS  It is suggested that coexpression of hbeta (1) exposes a more severe functional defect that results in a greater overlap in the relationship between channel inactivation and activation (window current) in T1620M, which is proposed to be a potential pathophysiological mechanism of IVF in vivo. One possible explanation for our finding is an altered alpha-/beta (1) -subunit association in the mutant.. \n", {"entities": [[37, 53, "DISEASE"], [224, 251, "DISEASE"], [253, 257, "DISEASE"], [263, 298, "DISEASE"], [300, 303, "DISEASE"], [806, 809, "DISEASE"], [933, 937, "DISEASE"], [1689, 1692, "DISEASE"]]}], ["A previous linkage study provided evidence for a prostate cancer-susceptibility locus at 1q24-25.

The present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24-25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary prostate cancer and ascertained by the members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) from North America, Australia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

The estimated proportion of families (alpha) linked to the locus was. 06 (1-LOD support interval. 01-. 12).

In the subset of 491 such families, the peak HLOD was 2. 56 (P =. 0006) and alpha =. 11 (1-LOD support interval. 04-. 19), compared with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families.

The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and, at the end of 1998, more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide. The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R, K285N, S135L, and N314D. Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent. Overall, it accounts for 60-70% of mutant chromosomes, but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations. Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems. Globally, K285N is rarer, but in many European populations it can be found on 25-40% of mutant chromosomes. It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype. S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans. In vitro expression results are discrepant, but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues. Duarte 1 (or Los Angeles) and Duarte 2 (or Duarte) variants carry the same amino acid substitution, N314D, even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity. N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles. N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems. However, there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals. It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities.

In parallel, measurement of the gut mucosal iron content as well as iron regulatory proteins allows a more informed evaluation of various hypotheses regarding the precise role of HFE in iron homeostasis.

We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer, using SSCP assays. Variant SSCP bands were subcloned and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals. Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families. A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer.

These results provide further evidence that inherited breast and ovarian cancer can occur as a consequence of a wide array of BRCA1 mutations.

We report herein the occurrence of three separate phenotypes within a single family with a novel 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin/RDS gene. DESIGN  Case reports with clinical features, fluorescein angiography, kinetic perimetry, electrophysiological studies, and molecular genetics. SETTING  University medical centers. PATIENTS  A 75-year-old woman, her two daughters (aged 44 and 50 years), and her 49-year-old son were screened for peripherin/RDS mutations because of the presence of multiple phenotypes within the same family. RESULTS  The mother presented at age 63 years with a profoundly abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) and adult-onset retinitis pigmentosa that progressed dramatically over 12 years, with marked loss of peripheral visual field. One daughter developed pattern macular dystrophy at age 31 years. At age 44 years, her ERG was moderately abnormal but her clinical disease was limited to the macula. Another daughter presented at age 42 years with macular degeneration and over 10 years developed the clinical picture of fundus flavimaculatus. Her peripheral visual field was preserved but her ERG was moderately abnormal. The son had onset of macular degeneration at age 44 years. Pericentral scotomas were present and the ERG was markedly abnormal. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate pigment epithelial transmission defects.

Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected, examined for appropriate size inserts, and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA. Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations. One, a point mutation in exon 3, resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine. Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells. About 5% of the control expression was observed, suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA. The second mutation, a G-to-A transition, occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron. The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site. Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele, but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected. A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients, members of their families, and normal controls was screened for these mutations. Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample. Gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data. No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified. However, combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease.

The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy. His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth. After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking, for which gavage feeding was needed. Motor development was delayed. After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite. Recurrent middle ear infections, a high pain threshold, and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported. There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance. Chromosomal analysis was normal (46, XY). DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities.

Although the biochemical function of BRCA1 is not well understood, it is important for DNA damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint. BRCA1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after DNA damage. It is not known whether BRCA1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in DNA damage response are related. In yeast the DNA damage response and the replication-block checkpoint are mediated partly through the Cds1 kinase family. Here we report that the human Cds1 kinase (hCds1/Chk2) regulates BRCA1 function after DNA damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of BRCA1.

This finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance for HMS in these families. We also report a mutation of the same exon 6 CTSC codon (2126C-- > T) in a Turkish family with classical PLS.

Two of these four rearrangements were complex, involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides. Of these four rearrangements, one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14. The fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14. Although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level, it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14. These rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually.

The unambiguous identification of a crossover event within hemochromatosis families is very difficult; it is particularly hampered by the variability of the phenotypic expression as well as by the sex- and age-related penetrance of the disease. For these practical considerations, traditional linkage analysis could prove of limited value in further refining the extrapolated physical position of HFE. We therefore embarked upon a linkage-disequilibrium analysis of HFE and normal chromosomes from the Brittany population. In the present report, 66 hemochromatosis families yielding 151 hemochromatosis chromosomes and 182 normal chromosomes were RFLP-typed with a battery of probes, including two newly derived polymorphic markers from the 6. 7 and HLA-F loci located 150 and 250 kb telomeric to HLA-A, respectively. The results suggest a strong peak of existing linkage disequilibrium focused within the i82-to-6. 7 interval (approximately 250 kb). The zone of linkage disequilibrium is flanked by the i97 locus, positioned 30 kb proximal to i82, and the HLA-F gene, found 250 kb distal to HLA-A, markers of which display no significant association with HFE. These data support the possibility that HFE resides within the 400-kb expanse of DNA between i97 and HLA-F. Alternatively, the very tight association of HLA-A3 and allele 1 of the 6. 7 locus, both of which are comprised by the major ancestral or founder HFE haplotype in Brittany, supports the possibility that the disease gene may reside immediately telomeric to the 6. 7 locus within the linkage-disequilibrium zone. Additionally, hemochromatosis haplotypes possessing HLA-A11 and the low-frequency HLA-F polymorphism (allele 2) are supportive of a separate founder chromosome containing a second, independently arising mutant allele. Overall, the establishment of a likely \" hemochromatosis critical region \" centromeric boundary and the identification of a linkage-disequilibrium zone both significantly contribute to a reduction in the amount of DNA required to be searched for novel coding sequences constituting the HFE defect \n", {"entities": [[26, 29, "GENE"], [585, 588, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [1344, 1347, "GENE"], [1389, 1392, "GENE"], [1603, 1606, "GENE"], [2272, 2275, "GENE"], [78, 81, "GENE"], [938, 941, "GENE"], [985, 988, "GENE"], [1245, 1248, "GENE"], [1280, 1283, "GENE"], [1450, 1453, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [1820, 1823, "GENE"], [1850, 1853, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [585, 588, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [1344, 1347, "GENE"], [1389, 1392, "GENE"], [1603, 1606, "GENE"], [2272, 2275, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [585, 588, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [1344, 1347, "GENE"], [1389, 1392, "GENE"], [1603, 1606, "GENE"], [2272, 2275, "GENE"], [938, 943, "GENE"], [1245, 1250, "GENE"], [1450, 1455, "GENE"], [1850, 1855, "GENE"], [985, 990, "GENE"], [1280, 1285, "GENE"], [938, 943, "GENE"], [1245, 1250, "GENE"], [1450, 1455, "GENE"], [1850, 1855, "GENE"], [985, 990, "GENE"], [1280, 1285, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [585, 588, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [1344, 1347, "GENE"], [1389, 1392, "GENE"], [1603, 1606, "GENE"], [2272, 2275, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [585, 588, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [1344, 1347, "GENE"], [1389, 1392, "GENE"], [1603, 1606, "GENE"], [2272, 2275, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [585, 588, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [1344, 1347, "GENE"], [1389, 1392, "GENE"], [1603, 1606, "GENE"], [2272, 2275, "GENE"], [938, 943, "GENE"], [1245, 1250, "GENE"], [1450, 1455, "GENE"], [1850, 1855, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [585, 588, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [1344, 1347, "GENE"], [1389, 1392, "GENE"], [1603, 1606, "GENE"], [2272, 2275, "GENE"], [100, 115, "DISEASE"], [131, 146, "DISEASE"], [374, 389, "DISEASE"], [864, 879, "DISEASE"], [902, 917, "DISEASE"], [1909, 1924, "DISEASE"], [2154, 2169, "DISEASE"], [2399, 2409, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Five male Japanese patients with complex glycerol kinase deficiency (CGKD) and their relatives were studied clinically, cytogenetically, and molecular-genetically.

Expression of FMRP in hair roots was studied by use of an FMRP-specific antibody test, and the percentage of FMRP-expressing hair roots in controls and in male fragile X patients was determined. Control individuals showed clear expression of FMRP in nearly every hair root, whereas male fragile X patients lacked expression of FMRP in almost all their hair roots. Mentally retarded female patients with a full mutation showed FMRP expression in only some of their hair roots (< 55%), and no overlap with normal female controls was observed. The advantages of this test are (1) plucking of hair follicles does no appreciable harm to the mentally retarded patient, (2) hairs can be sent in a simple envelope to a diagnostic center, and (3) the result of the test is available within 5 h of plucking.

We engineered a construct of the OCRL cDNA that encodes amino acids homologous to the platelet 5-phosphatase for expression in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. This cDNA encodes aa 264-968 of the OCRL protein. The recombinant protein was found to catalyze the reactions also carried out by platelet 5-phosphatase II. Thus OCRL converts inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate to inositol 1, 4-bisphosphate, and it converts inositol 1, 3, 4, 5-tetrakisphosphate to inositol 1, 3, 4-trisphosphate. Most important, the enzyme converts phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. The relative ability of OCRL to catalyze the three reactions is different from that of 5-phosphatase II and from that of another 5-phosphatase isoenzyme from platelets, 5-phosphatase I. The recombinant OCRL protein hydrolyzes the phospholipid substrate 10- to 30-fold better than 5-phosphatase II, and 5-phosphatase I does not cleave the lipid at all.

These results suggest that OCRL is mainly a lipid phosphatase that may control cellular levels of a critical metabolite, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate.

Our observation of differently sized repeats in various DM tissues from the same individual may explain why the size of the mutation observed in lymphocytes does not necessarily correlate with the severity and nature of symptoms.

A positive correlation between the size of the repeat and the intergenerational enlargement was observed similarly through male and female meioses for < or = 0. 5-kb CTG sequences. Beyond 0. 5 kb, the intergenerational variation was more important through female meioses, whereas a tendency to compression was observed almost exclusively in male meioses, for > or = 1. 5-kb fragments.

OBJECTIVE  To analyze Japanese patients clinically diagnosed as having XLRS formutational changes in the XLRS1 gene. METHODS  Ten patients with XLRS underwent full ophthalmologic examination, including slitlamp biomicroscopy and dilated funduscopy. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes, and all exons of the XLRS1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed using a direct sequencing method. RESULTS  Point mutations in the XLRS1 gene were identified in all 10 patients. The mutations were identical in each of 2 pairs of brothers. Six of the point mutations represented missense mutations, 1 was a nonsense mutation, and 1 was a frameshift mutation. Five of the mutations are newly reported herein. CONCLUSIONS  The discovery of new point mutations in this study increases the available information regarding the spectrum of genetic abnormalities and clinical manifestations of XLRS.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE  Identification of mutations in the XLRS1 gene and expanded information on clinical manifestations will facilitate early diagnosis, appropriate early therapy, and genetic counseling regarding the prognosis of XLRS.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 22, "DISEASE"], [75, 97, "DISEASE"], [99, 103, "DISEASE"], [126, 149, "DISEASE"], [162, 173, "DISEASE"], [394, 398, "DISEASE"], [467, 471, "DISEASE"], [1171, 1192, "DISEASE"], [1224, 1228, "DISEASE"], [1555, 1559, "DISEASE"]]}], ["IPA in immunocompromised rats caused a dramatic increase in chitinase activity.", {"entities": []}], ["Respondents were also asked which criteria are important for considering inhaled corticosteroids prescription in a COPD patient.", {"entities": []}], ["Based on the kinetic parameters of the dynamic gene regulatory network, we identify important properties (such as susceptibility to infection) of the immune system, which may be useful for translational research.", {"entities": []}], ["X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most frequent peroxisomal disease. It mainly involves the nervous system white matter, adrenal cortex and testes. Several distinct clinical phenotypes are known. The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs  > C22  0, mainly C26  0), which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. Diagnosis is usually based on the VLCFA levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers. In 0. 1% of affected males, however, the plasma C26  0 level is borderline normal, and 15% of obligate female carriers have normal results. Effective mutation detection in these families is therefore fundamental to unambiguously determine the genetic status of each individual at risk. Of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating X-ALD mutations, because normal VLCFA levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status. We describe a fast method for detection of X-ALD mutations. The method is based on SSCP analysis of nested PCR fragments followed by sequence-determination reactions. Using this methodology we have found X-ALD mutations in 30 kindreds, including 15 not previously reported. \n", {"entities": [[20, 49, "DISEASE"], [100, 129, "DISEASE"], [131, 136, "DISEASE"], [159, 178, "DISEASE"], [978, 983, "DISEASE"], [1107, 1112, "DISEASE"], [1268, 1273, "DISEASE"]]}], ["There was one neonatal death and one major congenital abnormality.", {"entities": []}], ["These results suggest that Tregs do not play a major role in immune suppression in the early hours of recovery from a marathon.", {"entities": []}], ["Brine shrimps and potato dics are used for anticancer and antitumor potency of extract.", {"entities": []}], ["Physicians need training in shared decision making skills about goals of care and in using the decision aid.", {"entities": []}], ["The axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by activating its receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer ).

METHODS  Eight patients with adult-onset ALD underwent clinical examination, brain and spine MRI, and SEP and MEP studies before and after 3 years of Lorenzos oil dietary therapy. RESULTS  Before treatment, brain MRI was normal in five patients. Three of these patients had pure spinal SEP abnormalities and in the remaining two patients SEPs showed signs of involvement of both the spinal and cerebral somatosensory tracts. After treatment, the three patients with pure spinal abnormalities showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening, whereas the two patients with a more advanced stage of disease (exhibited by SEPs) showed substantially unchanged clinical and neurophysiologic features. The patients with abnormal brain MRI at the onset of treatment showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening. CONCLUSIONS  Lorenzos oil therapy had no effect on patients with evidence of inflammatory brain lesions. Moreover, in patients without clear signs of inflammatory damage, this treatment does not modify significantly the natural course of the disease.

The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity.

Six additional pseudodeficient subjects were found to have the C739-to-T mutation. This allele accounted for 32% (20/62) of non-Jewish enzyme-defined Tay-Sachs disease carriers but for none of 36 Jewish enzyme-defined carriers who did not have one of three known mutations common to this group. The C739-to-T allele, together with a \" true \" Tay-Sachs disease allele, causes Hex A pseudodeficiency. Given both the large proportion of non-Jewish carriers with this allele and that standard biochemical screening cannot differentiate between heterozygotes for the C739-to-T mutations and Tay-Sachs disease carriers, DNA testing for this mutation in at-risk couples is essential. \n", {"entities": [[47, 56, "DISEASE"], [103, 138, "DISEASE"], [177, 194, "DISEASE"], [234, 252, "DISEASE"], [518, 535, "DISEASE"], [717, 734, "DISEASE"], [909, 926, "DISEASE"], [1153, 1170, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The two primary clinical outcomes are the duration of moderately bad (or worse) cough, and the severity of all its associated symptoms on days 2 to 4 post-randomisation.", {"entities": []}], ["Furthermore, transfer of overlying culture media [conditioned media (CM)] to other HAEC led to iNOS induction.", {"entities": []}], ["PCR testing identified more positive biopsy samples than culture (77.7% PCR positive versus 55.1% culture positive) and correctly identified all specimens scored as culture positive.", {"entities": []}], ["Ten healthy volunteers participated in a double blinded, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover laboratory study in order to determine whether a low dose of ketamine potentiated the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl without causing an increase in sedative effects.", {"entities": []}], ["Flow cytometry and recombinant DNA techniques have been used to obtain reagents for a molecular analysis of the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).

The geographical correlation of its distribution with the historical endemicity of malaria suggests that this disorder has risen in frequency through natural selection by malaria. However, attempts to confirm that G6PD deficiency is protective in case-control studies of malaria have yielded conflicting results. Hence, for this X-linked disorder, it is unclear whether both male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes are protected or, as frequently suggested, only females. Furthermore, how much protection may be afforded is unknown. Here we report that, in two large case-control studies of over 2, 000 African children, the common African form of G6PD deficiency (G6PD A-) is associated with a 46-58% reduction in risk of severe malaria for both female heterozygotes and male hemizygotes. A mathematical model incorporating the measured selective advantage against malaria suggests that a counterbalancing selective disadvantage, associated with this enzyme deficiency, has retarded its rise in frequency in malaria-endemic regions.

The prevention of Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis, type 1) depends on the identification of carriers of the gene for this autosomal recessive disorder. We compared the enzyme-based test widely used in screening for Tay-Sachs disease with a test based on analysis of DNA. We developed methods to detect the three mutations in the HEXA gene that occur with high frequency among Ashkenazi Jews  two mutations cause infantile Tay-Sachs disease, and the third causes the adult-onset form of the disease. DNA segments containing these mutation sites were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for the presence of the mutations. RESULTS. Among 62 Ashkenazi obligate carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, the three specific mutations accounted for all but one of the mutant alleles (98 percent). In 216 Ashkenazi carriers identified by the enzyme test, DNA analysis showed that 177 (82 percent) had one of the identified mutations. Of the 177, 79 percent had the exon 11 insertion mutation, 18 percent had the intron 12 splice-junction mutation, and 3 percent had the less severe exon 7 mutation associated with adult-onset disease. The results of the enzyme tests in the 39 subjects (18 percent) who were defined as carriers but in whom DNA analysis did not identify a mutant allele were probably false positive (although there remains some possibility of unidentified mutations). In addition, of 152 persons defined as noncarriers by the enzyme-based test, 1 was identified as a carrier by DNA analysis (i. e e., a false negative enzyme-test result). CONCLUSIONS.

Both the A-T phenotype and the similarity of the ATM protein to other DNA-damage sensors suggests a role for ATM in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition, signalling and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). There are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in A-T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The protein defective in NBS, nibrin (encoded by NBS1), forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 (refs 1, 2). This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time. The overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in A-T and NBS suggests that ATM and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway. Here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with IR. This response is abrogated in A-T cells that either do not express ATM protein or express near full-length mutant protein. We also show that ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin (S343A) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells. ATM phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association as revealed by radiation-induced foci formation.

METHODOLOGY  PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous. RESULTS  The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for > 6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group. CONCLUSIONS  The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances. Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU. The significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy.. \n", {"entities": [[94, 130, "DISEASE"], [148, 172, "DISEASE"], [332, 356, "DISEASE"], [358, 361, "DISEASE"], [417, 438, "DISEASE"], [463, 475, "DISEASE"], [758, 761, "DISEASE"], [772, 775, "DISEASE"], [782, 785, "DISEASE"], [791, 817, "DISEASE"], [819, 822, "DISEASE"], [1374, 1387, "DISEASE"], [1410, 1413, "DISEASE"], [1445, 1448, "DISEASE"], [1468, 1471, "DISEASE"], [1528, 1531, "DISEASE"], [1556, 1559, "DISEASE"], [1606, 1609, "DISEASE"], [1669, 1672, "DISEASE"], [1859, 1862, "DISEASE"], [2011, 2035, "DISEASE"], [2191, 2194, "DISEASE"], [2417, 2420, "DISEASE"]]}], ["An interview of the present prince, S Babaji Rajah Bhonsle was taken.", {"entities": []}], ["melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel to identify alleles associated with resistance to lead and/or cadmium, two ubiquitous environmental toxins that present serious health risks.", {"entities": []}], ["Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1. 1. 1. 49) -deficient red blood cells from male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes from the island of Sardinia were studied for their ability to support growth in vitro of the malaria-causing organism Plasmodium falciparum.

We used SSCP to analyze an amplified genomic DNA fragment containing exon 12 from seven individuals with Kniest dysplasia. An abnormality was identified in one patient.

The authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram (ERG) in a boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ERGs in five boys with DMD. The authors wanted to determined whether there were similar ERG findings in an animal model for DMD, the mdx mouse. METHODS. Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded in five boys with DMD after a complete ophthalmic examination. The dystrophin gene was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. ERGs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified Grass photostimulator (Grass Instrument Company, Quincy, MA). RESULTS. Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings, yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject. The subjects gene deletions were variable, ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions. The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice. CONCLUSIONS. The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity. The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons, including milder effects of the mouse gene defect, differences in muscle and retinal gene product, or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin.

Interestingly, Arg-610 is located within one of the two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of the FGD1 gene and it corresponds to a highly conserved residue which has been involved in InsP binding in PH domains of other proteins.

All 19 patients had WASP mutations, each of which localized to the initial three or terminal three exons of the gene, and the majority of which were unique in each case. However, a missense mutation which results in substitution of the arginine at WAS codon 86 was identified in three boys with severe WAS as well as in one boy presenting with thrombocytopenia alone.

These findings therefore confirm the association of WAS with WASP mutation and identify WASP mutation as a cause for isolated congenital thrombocytopenia in males. While the WASP gene defects responsible for isolated thrombocytopenia and other mild presentations of WAS do not appear distinct from those resulting in severe WAS, these data indicate that analysis of WASP gene mutation provides a valuable tool for distinguishing the spectrum of WAS patients and the subset of males with isolated thrombocytopenia who represent mild cases of WAS.. \n", {"entities": [[50, 74, "DISEASE"], [79, 104, "DISEASE"], [142, 145, "DISEASE"], [249, 263, "DISEASE"], [284, 317, "DISEASE"], [319, 322, "DISEASE"], [335, 359, "DISEASE"], [467, 470, "DISEASE"], [598, 601, "DISEASE"], [605, 630, "DISEASE"], [880, 883, "DISEASE"], [934, 937, "DISEASE"], [976, 992, "DISEASE"], [1039, 1064, "DISEASE"], [1184, 1187, "DISEASE"], [1322, 1325, "DISEASE"], [1396, 1423, "DISEASE"], [1478, 1503, "DISEASE"], [1536, 1539, "DISEASE"], [1594, 1597, "DISEASE"], [1715, 1718, "DISEASE"], [1757, 1782, "DISEASE"], [1811, 1814, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The current study investigated the effect of high-dose NAC on airway geometry, inflammation, and oxidative stress in COPD patients.", {"entities": []}], ["The inflammatome signature is highly enriched for immune response-related genes, disease causal genes, and drug targets.", {"entities": []}], ["Our survey revealed that both patients and physicians prioritized analgesic efficacy of NSAID plasters.", {"entities": []}], ["The mean 25(OH)D concentration at each time point was measured, and the individual 25(OH)D z scores based on year 11 values were used as the reference.", {"entities": []}], ["The onset of plastic bronchitis (PB) can be debilitating in survivors of Fontan surgery.", {"entities": [[21, 31, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Surface expressions of BTLA, CD127, and CD49/CD29 were increased on subsets of CD8+ T cells from MS patients.", {"entities": [[23, 27, "GENE"]]}], ["Type I von Willebrand disease (vWD) is characterized by equally low plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF  Ag) and ristocetin cofactor (RiCof) and by the presence of all vWF multimers in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -agarose gel electrophoresis.

We recently identified the gene causing FMF, designated MEFV, and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils, suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator. To facilitate our understanding of the normal function of MEFV, we extended our previous studies. MEFV messenger RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes, with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization. CD34 hematopoietic stem-cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed MEFV at the myelocyte stage, concurrently with lineage commitment. The prepromyelocytic cell line HL60 expressed MEFV only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. MEFV was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1. Among peripheral blood leukocytes, MEFV expression was detected in neutrophils, eosinophils, and to varying degrees, monocytes. Consistent with the tissue specificity of expression, complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of MEFV revealed homology to myeloid-specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements. In vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon (IFN) gamma, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide induced MEFV expression, whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression. Induction by IFN-gamma occurred rapidly and was resistant to cycloheximide. IFN-alpha also induced MEFV expression. In granulocytes, MEFV was up-regulated by IFN-gamma and the combination of IFN-alpha and colchicine. These results refine understanding of MEFV by placing the gene in the myelomonocytic-specific proinflammatory pathway and identifying it as an IFN-gamma immediate early gene.. \n", {"entities": [[196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [597, 601, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [196, 200, "GENE"], [371, 375, "GENE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [685, 689, "GENE"], [798, 802, "GENE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [958, 962, "GENE"], [1172, 1176, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [1676, 1680, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1832, 1836, "GENE"], [13, 41, "DISEASE"], [149, 177, "DISEASE"], [179, 182, "DISEASE"], [189, 207, "DISEASE"], [237, 242, "DISEASE"], [247, 287, "DISEASE"], [329, 332, "DISEASE"], [1526, 1531, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity in skin fibroblasts from seven patients with unidentified defects of fatty acid oxidation was measured in the presence and absence of antibodies against medium-chain, long-chain, and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (VLCAD).

The finding that ATM-heterozygotes have an increased relative risk for breast cancer was supported by some studies but not confirmed by others. In view of this discrepancy, we examined the frequency of ATM germline mutations in a selected group of Dutch patients with breast cancer. We have analyzed ATM germline mutations in normal blood lymphocytes, using the protein-truncation test followed by genomic-sequence analysis. A high percentage of ATM germline mutations was demonstrated among patients with sporadic breast cancer. The 82 patients included in this study had developed breast cancer at age < 45 and had survived >/= 5 years (mean 15 years), and in 33 (40%) of the patients a contralateral breast tumor had been diagnosed. Among these patients we identified seven (8. 5%) ATM germline mutations, of which five are distinct. One splice-site mutation (IVS10-6T-- > G) was detected three times in our series. Four heterozygous carriers were patients with bilateral breast cancer. Our results indicate that the mutations identified in this study are \" A-T disease-causing \" mutations that might be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in heterozygotes. We conclude that ATM heterozygotes have an approximately ninefold-increased risk of developing a type of breast cancer characterized by frequent bilateral occurrence, early age at onset, and long-term survival.

The corresponding mutant recombinant protein, rvWF (G561S), formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional defect as the patients plasma vWF, confirming that this mutation causes von Willebrand disease type B. These data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vWF can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vWF binding to platelets by different mechanisms. The normal botrocetin-induced binding and the defective ristocetin-induced binding of rvWF (G561S) suggest that the primary defect in von Willebrand disease type B may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein Ib binding function of vWF.. \n", {"entities": [[23, 26, "GENE"], [169, 172, "GENE"], [390, 393, "GENE"], [709, 712, "GENE"], [852, 855, "GENE"], [936, 939, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [23, 26, "GENE"], [169, 172, "GENE"], [390, 393, "GENE"], [709, 712, "GENE"], [852, 855, "GENE"], [936, 939, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [23, 26, "GENE"], [169, 172, "GENE"], [390, 393, "GENE"], [709, 712, "GENE"], [852, 855, "GENE"], [936, 939, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [23, 26, "GENE"], [169, 172, "GENE"], [390, 393, "GENE"], [709, 712, "GENE"], [852, 855, "GENE"], [936, 939, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [23, 26, "GENE"], [169, 172, "GENE"], [390, 393, "GENE"], [709, 712, "GENE"], [852, 855, "GENE"], [936, 939, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [23, 26, "GENE"], [169, 172, "GENE"], [390, 393, "GENE"], [709, 712, "GENE"], [852, 855, "GENE"], [936, 939, "GENE"], [1242, 1245, "GENE"], [0, 29, "DISEASE"], [92, 106, "DISEASE"], [151, 165, "DISEASE"], [565, 594, "DISEASE"], [902, 931, "DISEASE"], [1271, 1300, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The active components, drug targets and therapeutic mechanisms have been comprehensively analyzed by systems-pharmacology methods.", {"entities": []}], ["The recently cloned human breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, is located on human chromosome 17q21.

First, MJD is associated with expansion fo the array from the normal range of 14-37 repeats to 68-84 repeats in most Japanese and Caucasian subjects, but no subjects were observed with expansions intermediate in size between those of the normal and MJD affected groups. Second, the expanded allele associated with MJD displays inter-generational instability, particularly in male meioses, and this instability was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation. Third, the size of the expanded allele is not only inversely correlated with the age-of-onset of MJD (r = -0.738, p < 0.001), but is also correlated with the frequency of other clinical features [e.g. pseudoexophthalmos and pyramidal signs were more frequent in subjects with large repeats (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 respectively)]. Fourth, the disease phenotype is significantly more severe and had an early age of onset (16 years) in a subject homozygous for the expanded allele, which contrasts with Huntington disease and suggests that the expanded allele in the MJD1 gene could exert its effect either by a dominant negative effect (putatively excluded in HD) or by a gain of function effect as proposed for HD. Finally, Japanese and Caucasian subjects affected with MJD share haplotypes at several markers surrounding the MJD1 gene, which are uncommon in the normal Japanese and Caucasian population, and which suggests the existence either of common founders in these populations or of chromosomes susceptible to pathologic expansion of the CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene.\n", {"entities": [[173, 195, "DISEASE"], [427, 449, "DISEASE"], [451, 454, "DISEASE"], [506, 509, "DISEASE"], [748, 751, "DISEASE"], [813, 816, "DISEASE"], [1067, 1070, "DISEASE"], [1470, 1488, "DISEASE"], [1628, 1630, "DISEASE"], [1680, 1682, "DISEASE"], [1739, 1742, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The average concentration of TCE in the workplace breathing zone was 27.83 \u00b1 6.02 ppm.", {"entities": []}], ["Sophisticated computer-based methods are essential for the analysis and interpretation of these complex datasets.", {"entities": []}], ["ASM cells were treated with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and/or interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) for 24\u2009h in the presence of calcitriol and/or the glucocorticoid fluticasone added 2\u2009h before.", {"entities": []}], ["The human body also hosts vast numbers of bacteria in several habitats.", {"entities": []}], ["The human eye malformation aniridia results from haploinsufficiency of PAX6, a paired box DNA-binding protein.

The classic form of ALD usually has onset in childhood (childhood cerebral ALD), with rapid neurologic deterioration leading to a vegetative state. Adult-onset cerebral ALD also presents with rapidly progressive neurologic dysfunction. Milder phenotypes such as adrenomyeloneuropathy and Addison disease only also have been recognized. Despite discovery of the causative gene, a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES  To conduct mutational analyses in 29 Japanese patients with ALD from 29 unrelated families, to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in this gene, and to study genotype-phenotype correlations in Japanese patients. METHODS  The 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral ALD, 11 patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD, and 5 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy. We conducted detailed mutational analyses of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with ALD by genomic Southern blot analysis and direct nucleotide sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products derived from total RNA that was extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cells, or peripheral blood leukocytes. RESULTS  Three patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD were identified as having large genomic rearrangements. The remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent mutations, including 12 novel mutations resulting in small nucleotide alterations in the ALD gene. Eighteen (69%) of 26 mutations were missense mutations. Most missense mutations involved amino acids conserved in homologous gene products, including PMP70, mALDRP, and Pxa1p. The AG dinucleotide deletion at position 1081-1082, which has been reported previously to be the most common mutation in white patients (12% -17%), was also identified as the most common mutation in Japanese patients (12%). All phenotypes were associated with mutations resulting in protein truncation or subtle amino acid changes. There were no differences in phenotypic expressions between missense mutations involving conserved amino acids and those involving nonconserved amino acids. CONCLUSIONS  There are no obvious correlations between the phenotypes of patients with ALD and their genotypes, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors modify the phenotypic expressions of ALD.. \n", {"entities": [[94, 123, "DISEASE"], [137, 166, "DISEASE"], [168, 171, "DISEASE"], [179, 196, "DISEASE"], [226, 248, "DISEASE"], [279, 300, "DISEASE"], [322, 325, "DISEASE"], [358, 380, "DISEASE"], [394, 418, "DISEASE"], [462, 474, "DISEASE"], [514, 536, "DISEASE"], [564, 585, "DISEASE"], [590, 605, "DISEASE"], [834, 837, "DISEASE"], [1048, 1070, "DISEASE"], [1101, 1113, "DISEASE"], [1135, 1156, "DISEASE"], [1239, 1242, "DISEASE"], [1546, 1558, "DISEASE"], [1771, 1774, "DISEASE"], [2533, 2536, "DISEASE"], [2650, 2653, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Deuterated glucose and glycerol were infused intravenously along with a pancreatic clamp (somatostatin with replacement of glucagon, insulin and growth hormone) and adrenaline.", {"entities": []}], ["There were also higher rates of smoking cessation (21% v 8%, P<0.004) and lower cumulative death rates from all causes (1% v 3%, P<0.009) in the intervention community than in the control community during the four year follow-up.", {"entities": []}], ["Here the authors carry out a two-stage genome-wide association study in over 8,000 Europeans and identify two new MZL risk loci at chromosome 6p, implicating the major histocompatibility complex in the disease for the first time.", {"entities": []}], ["The sample consisted of 2004 (1,355 living and 649 dead) older adults.", {"entities": []}], ["The order of fourteen polymorphic markers localised to the long arm of human chromosome 19 has been established by multipoint mapping in a set of 40 CEPH (Centre dEtude de Polymorphisme Humain, Paris) reference families.

The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene, consisting of 15 exons. Using a transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model, we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns. Use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8, which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a VSGGG peptide motif, and/or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14, which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame, occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined. In contrast, the excision of exons 13/14 that causes a frameshift and creates a C-terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle. We generated all six full-length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full-length (heart-, skeletal muscle- or brain-specific) and two C-terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa (smooth muscle-specific) isoforms.

Most mutations are linked to specific haplotypes, as defined by eight polymorphic restriction sites in the PAH gene. We hypothesized that there is at least one mild mutation linked to haplotype 12 in the Swedish PKU/HPA population, since 7 of 8 patients carrying haplotype 12 had mild HPA. Sequence analysis revealed a C-to-G transversion at the second base of codon 322, resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine, in four mutant haplotype 12 genes, and a G-to-A transition at the second base of codon 408, resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine, in another three mutant haplotype 12 genes. These mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles in nuclear families but were not present on normal or other mutant alleles. Both mutations were tested in a eukaryotic expression system in which enzyme activities of different mutant PAH enzymes reflect the relative severities of the mutations, although these in vitro activities cannot be translated directly into in vivo hepatic activities. The A322G mutant PAH had about 75% and the R408Q mutant PAH about 55% of the wild-type PAH enzyme activity.

To determine the extent of heterogeneity of G6PD, we have studied several different Indian populations by screening for G6PD deficiency, followed by molecular analysis of deficient alleles. The frequency of G6PD deficiency varies between 3% and 15% in different tribal and urban groups. Remarkably, a previously unreported deficient variant, G6PD Orissa (44 Ala-- > Gly), is responsible for most of the G6PD deficiency in tribal Indian populations but is not found in urban populations, where most of the G6PD deficiency is due to the G6PD Mediterranean (188 Ser-- > Phe) variant.

In response to this stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) is stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF/TCF family. One of the target genes for beta-catenin/TCF encodes c-MYC, explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer, particularly in the colon. Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas. Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Here, we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour. We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing tumour cells, providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells. At least 75% of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far, and directly implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans.. \n", {"entities": [[131, 137, "GENE"], [1485, 1491, "GENE"], [489, 492, "GENE"], [131, 137, "GENE"], [1485, 1491, "GENE"], [15, 26, "DISEASE"], [443, 449, "DISEASE"], [483, 496, "DISEASE"], [539, 565, "DISEASE"], [567, 570, "DISEASE"], [855, 867, "DISEASE"], [879, 893, "DISEASE"], [1021, 1035, "DISEASE"], [1210, 1221, "DISEASE"], [1262, 1268, "DISEASE"], [1312, 1326, "DISEASE"], [1385, 1392, "DISEASE"], [1615, 1622, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD) is an X-linked developmental defect of myelination affecting the central nervous system and segregating with the proteolipoprotein (PLP) locus.

A G-to-C transition at the second base of codon 413 in exon 12 of the gene results in the substitution of Pro413 for Arg413 in the mutant protein. This mutation (R413P) results in negligible enzymatic activity when expressed in heterologous mammalian cells and is compatible with a classic PKU phenotype in the patient.

We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer. METHODS  We examined genomic DNA from 83 (for BRCA1 185delAG) or 82 (for BRCA2 6174delT) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, most of whom were treated at a relatively young age, for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population. RESULTS  Our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, only one (1. 15%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3. 6%) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele, and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation (2. 4%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6. 2%). CONCLUSIONS  The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence (about 1%) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population.

We report here that the VHL gene is linked to the locus encoding the human homologoue of the RAF1 oncogene, which maps to chromosome 3p25 (ref. 4). Crossovers with the VHL locus suggest that the defect responsible for the VHL phenotype is not a mutation in the RAF1 gene itself. An alternative or prior event to oncogene activation in tumour formation may be the inactivation of a putative tumour suppressor which can be associated with both the inherited and sporadic forms of the cancer.

Furthermore, rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight ALD kindreds. This led us to propose that a single DNA rearrangement could underlie both ALD and abnormal color vision in these patients. Study of 34 French ALD patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green/red visual pigment rearrangements 3 to the red/green color vision gene complex. The previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of \" abnormal \" color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic color vision defects. The red/green color pigment (R/GCP) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients, and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes. The R/GCP region was also analyzed in 29 French and seven North American ALD patients by using six genomic DNA probes, isolated from a cosmid walk, that flank the color vision genes. No deletions were found with probes that lie 3 of the green pigment genes. One of the eight previously reported ALD individuals has a long deletion 5 of the red pigment gene, a deletion causing blue cone monochromacy. This finding and the previous findings of a 45% frequency of phenotypic color vision defects in patients with AMN may suggest that the ALD/AMN gene lies 5 to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted DNA that includes regulatory genes for color vision. It is possible, however, that phenotypic color vision anomalies in AMN may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the disease.

We performed a linkage study of chromosome 22 in 200 families with AS affected sibling-pairs. Association of alleles of the CYP2D6 gene was examined by both case-control and within-family means. For case-control studies, 617 unrelated individuals with AS (361 probands from sibling-pair and parent-case trio families and 256 unrelated non-familial sporadic cases) and 402 healthy ethnically matched controls were employed. For within-family association studies, 361 families including 161 parent-case trios and 200 affected sibling-pair families were employed. Homozygosity for poor metabolizer alleles was found to be associated with AS. Heterozygosity for the most frequent poor metabolizer allele (CYP2D6*4) was not associated with increased susceptibility to AS.

Three congenital anomaly disorders, cat-eye syndrome, der () syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS) are associated with tetrasomy, trisomy or monosomy, respectively, for part of chromosome 22q11. VCFS/DGS is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements. In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements, the deletion end-points in a large number of VCFS/DGS patients were defined by haplotype analysis. Most VCFS/DGS patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion, some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1. 5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations. The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS/DGS patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats, termed LCR22s. To support this idea further, we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS/DGS patients. We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events, thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders.

First, MJD is associated with expansion fo the array from the normal range of 14-37 repeats to 68-84 repeats in most Japanese and Caucasian subjects, but no subjects were observed with expansions intermediate in size between those of the normal and MJD affected groups. Second, the expanded allele associated with MJD displays inter-generational instability, particularly in male meioses, and this instability was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation. Third, the size of the expanded allele is not only inversely correlated with the age-of-onset of MJD (r = -0.738, p < 0.001), but is also correlated with the frequency of other clinical features [e.g. pseudoexophthalmos and pyramidal signs were more frequent in subjects with large repeats (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 respectively)]. Fourth, the disease phenotype is significantly more severe and had an early age of onset (16 years) in a subject homozygous for the expanded allele, which contrasts with Huntington disease and suggests that the expanded allele in the MJD1 gene could exert its effect either by a dominant negative effect (putatively excluded in HD) or by a gain of function effect as proposed for HD. Finally, Japanese and Caucasian subjects affected with MJD share haplotypes at several markers surrounding the MJD1 gene, which are uncommon in the normal Japanese and Caucasian population, and which suggests the existence either of common founders in these populations or of chromosomes susceptible to pathologic expansion of the CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene.\n", {"entities": [[173, 195, "DISEASE"], [427, 449, "DISEASE"], [451, 454, "DISEASE"], [506, 509, "DISEASE"], [748, 751, "DISEASE"], [813, 816, "DISEASE"], [1067, 1070, "DISEASE"], [1470, 1488, "DISEASE"], [1628, 1630, "DISEASE"], [1680, 1682, "DISEASE"], [1739, 1742, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Finally, we explored results by level of development using the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).", {"entities": []}], ["The discourse analysis showed certain gaps and variations within the screened leaflets when addressing the following aspects: cost of the telehealth service, confidentiality, patients\u2019 choices in addition to equipment use and technical support.", {"entities": []}], ["Through application of stringent criteria, a total of 633 proteins were quantitatively identified.", {"entities": []}], ["Models were fit on 223 non-genetic variables plus 215 single nucleotide polymorphisms.", {"entities": []}], ["A Saudi Arab boy presented in early childhood with thrombocytopenia, morphologically large and normal sized platelets, increased mean platelet volume, and a hypermegakaryocytic bone marrow.

The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of DMPK and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene, SIX5 (formerly DMAHP; refs 2-5). There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM. First, repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels. Second, CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription. Third, toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA (refs 10, 11). Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of Dm15 (the mouse DMPK homologue) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders. To test the role of Six5 loss in DM, we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted. Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive. Six5 +/- and Six5-/- mice show increased steady-state levels of the Na +/K + -ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels. Thus, altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation. As ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM, these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM.

Many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene RS1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating. RS1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein, retinoschisin, which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function. We have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin, which detects a protein of approximately 28 kDa in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol, but multimers sized > 40 kDa under non-reducing conditions. A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae. We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA (using in situ hybridization with riboprobes) and retinoschisin (using immunohistochemistry). The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina. Furthermore, differentiated retinoblastoma cells (Weri-Rb1 cells) were found to express RS1 mRNA and to release retinoschisin. These results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers. Thus, X-linked retinoschisis is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo-receptor protein associated with a retinal dystrophy.. \n", {"entities": [[246, 249, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [914, 917, "GENE"], [1050, 1053, "GENE"], [1299, 1302, "GENE"], [246, 249, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [914, 917, "GENE"], [1050, 1053, "GENE"], [1299, 1302, "GENE"], [246, 249, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [914, 917, "GENE"], [1050, 1053, "GENE"], [1299, 1302, "GENE"], [246, 249, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [914, 917, "GENE"], [1050, 1053, "GENE"], [1299, 1302, "GENE"], [246, 249, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [914, 917, "GENE"], [1050, 1053, "GENE"], [1299, 1302, "GENE"], [19, 41, "DISEASE"], [137, 159, "DISEASE"], [283, 303, "DISEASE"], [1376, 1390, "DISEASE"], [1604, 1626, "DISEASE"], [1779, 1796, "DISEASE"]]}], ["An abbreviated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R) was used to assess verbal and arithmetical cognitive performance in 55 subjects with myotonic dystrophy (DM), covering all grades of disease severity, and 31 controls at 50% risk of inheriting DM.

Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations. Therefore, we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations, by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences. Each family contained  (i) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years; or (ii) three or more cases of gastric cancer. Novel germline CDH1 mutations (a nonsense and a splice site) were detected in two families (25%). Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain. In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer; thus, in addition to six cases of gastric cancer, a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years. We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations. However, only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations. Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers, and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer.

The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs, whereas p95/nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA double-strand breaks. Here, because of the similarities between AT and NBS, we evaluated the functional interactions between ATM and p95/nbs1. Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells indicated that p95/nbs1 may not be required for signalling to ATM after ionizing radiation. However, p95/nbs1 was phosphorylated on serine 343 in an ATM-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation.

Macro-orchidism was absent in knockout mice carrying the YAC transgene indicating functional rescue by the human protein. Given the complex behavioral phenotype in fragile X patients and the mild phenotype previously reported for the Fmr1 knockout mouse, we performed a more thorough evaluation of the Fmr1 knockout phenotype using additional behavioral assays that had not previously been reported for this animal model. The mouse displayed reduced anxiety-related responses with increased exploratory behavior.

The murine gene contains ten exons with a coding sequence of 2304 bp, while the rat homolog has nine exons with a coding sequence of 2253 bp.

The predicted rodent proteins have several important domains and signals found in human pyrin, including a B-box zinc finger domain, Robbins-Dingwall nuclear localization signal, and coiled-coil domain. However, perhaps because of an ancient frame-shift mutation, neither the mouse nor the rat protein has an intact C-terminal B30. 2 domain, in which most FMF-associated mutations have been found in human MEFV.

Thus, it appears that C3 deficiency in Brittany spaniel dogs not only shares biochemical and clinical features with C3 deficiency in humans, but also shares some genetic characteristics with the human disorder.. \n", {"entities": [[23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [23, 25, "GENE"], [171, 173, "GENE"], [243, 245, "GENE"], [354, 356, "GENE"], [399, 401, "GENE"], [482, 484, "GENE"], [563, 565, "GENE"], [684, 686, "GENE"], [778, 780, "GENE"], [33, 80, "DISEASE"], [130, 143, "DISEASE"], [278, 291, "DISEASE"], [506, 519, "DISEASE"], [670, 683, "DISEASE"], [791, 804, "DISEASE"], [885, 898, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Viability of cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from rats exposed to concentrated PM was significantly decreased during 4 of 6 weeks, compared with rats exposed to filtered air (p< 0.05).", {"entities": []}], ["Fifty-four male-smokers of more than five pack-years (PY) and aged 40\u201360 years were included (29 Non-COPD, 16 COPD).", {"entities": []}], ["A panel of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) has been screened with the cDNA probes Cf56a and Cf23a, which detect exons in the central part of the DMD gene.

Although greater than 400 variants have been described based on clinical and biochemical criteria, little is known about the molecular basis of these G6PD deficiencies. Recently, the gene that encodes human G6PD has been cloned and sequenced, which enables us to examine directly the heterogeneity of G6PD at the DNA level. During the past 10 years, we examined the G6PD activity in 21, 271 newborn Chinese infants (11, 400 males and 9, 871 females) and identified 314 (2. 8%) males and 246 (2. 5%) females having low G6PD activity. The G6PD gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. Our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the G6PD polymorphism in Taiwan. The first type of mutation (487 G----A) was found in an affected Chinese with a G to A change at nucleotide 487, which results in a (163) Gly to Ser substitution. The second type of mutation (493 A----G) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected Chinese. This mutation causes an A to G change at nucleotide position 493, producing an (165) Asn to Asp substitution. Interestingly, the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations create Alu I and Ava II recognition sites, respectively, which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by PCR/restriction enzyme (RE) digestion method. The third mutation (1376 G----T) was found in four affected Chinese. This mutation causes a G to T change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an (459) Arg to Leu substitution. The 1376 G----T mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes G6PD deficiency in Taiwan. Finally, two affected Chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation (1388 G----A). This mutation causes a G to A change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an (463) Arg to His substitution. Our studies provide the direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency in the Chinese populations of Taiwan and the PCR/RE digestion method is suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations.\n", {"entities": [[35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [35, 39, "GENE"], [305, 309, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [456, 460, "GENE"], [521, 525, "GENE"], [673, 677, "GENE"], [692, 696, "GENE"], [924, 928, "GENE"], [1853, 1857, "GENE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [99, 165, "DISEASE"], [191, 202, "DISEASE"], [404, 421, "DISEASE"], [1952, 1967, "DISEASE"], [2243, 2258, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Exogenous miR-503 inhibited VEGF release from primary adult and fetal lung fibroblasts but not IL-8 release.", {"entities": [[10, 17, "GENE"]]}], ["However, high fat intake induced hyperleptinemia in MD rats as early as PND35, but not until PND85 in control males and control females did not become hyperleptinemic on the HFD even at PND102.", {"entities": []}], ["Thus the ethnomedicinal practice in Garo Hills is considered rich as it encompasses three different groups.", {"entities": []}], ["Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by predisposition for bilateral and multi-centric hemangioblastoma in the retina and central nervous system, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and cysts in the kidney, pancreas, and epididymis.

Our data support the previously established observation that families with a germline deletion have a low risk for pheochromocytoma.

Twenty-eight index patients with protein S deficiency and a PROS1 gene defect were studied, together with 109 first-degree relatives. To avoid selection bias, we confined analysis of total and free protein S levels and thrombotic risk to the patients relatives. In this group of relatives, a low free protein S level was the most reliable predictor of a PROS1 gene defect (sensitivity 97. 7%, specificity 100%). First-degree relatives with a PROS1 gene defect had a 5. 0-fold higher risk of thrombosis (95% confidence interval, 1. 5-16. 8) than those with a normal PROS1 gene and no other recognized thrombophilic defect. Although pregnancy/puerperium and immobility/trauma were important precipitating factors for thrombosis, almost half of the events were spontaneous. Relatives with splice-site or major structural defects in the PROS1 gene were more likely to have had a thrombotic event and had significantly lower total and free protein S levels than those relatives having missense mutations.

A somatic VHL gene mutation was detected in one of the two tumors by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Direct sequencing revealed a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 694, resulting in the replacement of an arginine with a stop codon after the sixth amino acid of exon 3.

We, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene SIX5 (refs 7, 8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype, we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter. Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues, including the developing lens.

Clues from attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1, 250-1, 450) indicate, however, that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function. We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region (codons 1, 194-1, 392 at most) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas, in contrast to other FAP patients, whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region. Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages, with mutations close to codon 1, 300 providing the greatest advantage.

Thus, the D442G mutation acts differently to the null mutations with weaker effects on HDL in the homozygous state and stronger effects in the heterozygotes, suggesting dominant expression of a partially defective allele.

DXS42 was mapped to the derivative chromosome X containing Xpterq25, and DXS10 was mapped to the derivative chromosome 3 containing Xq25-qter. The markers DXS10 and DXS42 therefore show tight linkage with OCRL in six families and flank the Xq25 breakpoint in a female patient with an X; 3 translocation. Linkage analysis with flanking markers was used to assess OCRL carrier status in women at risk.

We investigated the metabolism of the HDL apolipoproteins (apo) apoA-I and apoA-II in a total of five patients with LCAT deficiency, one with classic LCAT deficiency and four with Fish-eye disease. Plasma levels of apoA-II were decreased to a proportionately greater extent (23% of normal) than apoA-I (30% of normal). In addition, plasma concentrations of HDL particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (LpA-I  A-II) were much lower (18% of normal) than those of particles containing only apoA-I (LpA-I) (51% of normal). The metabolic basis for the low levels of apoA-II and LpA-I  A-II was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques. The mean plasma residence time of apoA-I was decreased at 2. 08 +/- 0. 27 d (controls 4. 74 +/- 0. 65 days); however, the residence time of apoA-II was even shorter at 1. 66 +/- 0. 24 d (controls 5. 25 +/- 0. 61 d). In addition, the catabolism of apoA-I in LpA-I  A-II was substantially faster than that of apoA-I in LpA-I. In summary, genetic syndromes of either complete or partial LCAT deficiency result in low levels of HDL through preferential hypercatabolism of apoA-II and HDL particles containing apoA-II. Because LpA-I has been proposed to be more protective than LpA-I  A-II against atherosclerosis, this selective effect on the metabolism of LpA-I  A-II may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic LCAT deficiency and Fish-eye disease are not at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I \n", {"entities": [[58, 62, "GENE"], [105, 109, "GENE"], [429, 433, "GENE"], [463, 467, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1752, 1756, "GENE"], [58, 62, "GENE"], [105, 109, "GENE"], [429, 433, "GENE"], [463, 467, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1752, 1756, "GENE"], [58, 62, "GENE"], [105, 109, "GENE"], [429, 433, "GENE"], [463, 467, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1752, 1756, "GENE"], [58, 62, "GENE"], [105, 109, "GENE"], [429, 433, "GENE"], [463, 467, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1752, 1756, "GENE"], [58, 62, "GENE"], [105, 109, "GENE"], [429, 433, "GENE"], [463, 467, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1752, 1756, "GENE"], [58, 62, "GENE"], [105, 109, "GENE"], [429, 433, "GENE"], [463, 467, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1752, 1756, "GENE"], [135, 173, "DISEASE"], [178, 194, "DISEASE"], [275, 291, "DISEASE"], [293, 316, "DISEASE"], [469, 507, "DISEASE"], [625, 640, "DISEASE"], [651, 674, "DISEASE"], [689, 705, "DISEASE"], [1814, 1829, "DISEASE"], [1940, 1963, "DISEASE"], [1968, 1984, "DISEASE"], [2025, 2040, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Therefore, these simple questionnaires could be used as predictive tools to identify patients whos\u2019 adherence needs to be improved.", {"entities": []}], ["The loneliness-physical multimorbidity association was significantly mediated by stressful life events (% mediated 11.1%-30.5%), anxiety (30.2%), and depression (15.4%).", {"entities": []}], ["Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22, which fuse the collagen type Ialpha1 (COLIA1) gene to the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain (PDGFB) gene.

Expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells. The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of COLIA1/PDGFB-expressing cells but had no effects on control cells. The presence of dimeric COLIA1/PDGFB precursors was demonstrated through PDGFB immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with COLIA1 antibodies. Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the COLIA1/PDGFB precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild-type PDGF-BB. Finally, COLIA1/PDGFB-expressing cells generated tumors after s. c c. injection into nude mice, and tumor growth was reduced by treatment with CGP57148B. We conclude that the COLIA1/PDGFB fusion associated with DFSP contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of PDGF-BB and the formation of an autocrine loop. Our findings, thus, suggest that PDGF receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of DFSP and giant cell fibroblastoma, e. g., through the use of PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors such as CGP57148B.\n", {"entities": [[212, 217, "GENE"], [296, 301, "GENE"], [434, 439, "GENE"], [686, 691, "GENE"], [777, 782, "GENE"], [819, 824, "GENE"], [889, 894, "GENE"], [1016, 1021, "GENE"], [1131, 1136, "GENE"], [1297, 1302, "GENE"], [212, 217, "GENE"], [296, 301, "GENE"], [434, 439, "GENE"], [686, 691, "GENE"], [777, 782, "GENE"], [819, 824, "GENE"], [889, 894, "GENE"], [1016, 1021, "GENE"], [1131, 1136, "GENE"], [1297, 1302, "GENE"], [212, 217, "GENE"], [296, 301, "GENE"], [434, 439, "GENE"], [686, 691, "GENE"], [777, 782, "GENE"], [819, 824, "GENE"], [889, 894, "GENE"], [1016, 1021, "GENE"], [1131, 1136, "GENE"], [1297, 1302, "GENE"], [4, 35, "DISEASE"], [201, 232, "DISEASE"], [234, 238, "DISEASE"], [1365, 1371, "DISEASE"], [1416, 1421, "DISEASE"], [1527, 1531, "DISEASE"], [1547, 1552, "DISEASE"], [1742, 1746, "DISEASE"], [1751, 1775, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), a non-neuronopathic lysosomal storage disorder, results from the deficient activity of acid beta-glucosidase (GBA).

To investigate the genetic history of these mutations in the AJ population, short tandem repeat (STR) markers were used to map a 9. 3-cM region containing the GBA locus and to genotype 261 AJ N370S chromosomes, 60 European non-Jewish N370S chromosomes, and 62 AJ 84GG chromosomes. A highly conserved haplotype at four markers flanking GBA (PKLR, D1S1595, D1S2721, and D1S2777) was observed on both the AJ chromosomes and the non-Jewish N370S chromosomes, suggesting the occurrence of a founder common to both populations. Of note, the presence of different divergent haplotypes suggested the occurrence of de novo, recurrent N370S mutations. In contrast, a different conserved haplotype at these markers was identified on the 84GG chromosomes, which was unique to the AJ population. On the basis of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) delta values, the non-Jewish European N370S chromosomes had greater haplotype diversity and less LD at the markers flanking the conserved haplotype than did the AJ N370S chromosomes. This finding is consistent with the presence of the N370S mutation in the non-Jewish European population prior to the founding of the AJ population. Coalescence analyses for the N370S and 84GG mutations estimated similar coalescence times, of 48 and 55.5 generations ago, respectively.

FRDA is caused by a GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the FRDA gene on chromosome 9q13 in 97% of patients. The FRDA gene encodes a widely expressed 210-aa protein, frataxin, which is located in mitochondria and is severely reduced in FRDA patients. Frataxin function is still unknown but the knockout of the yeast frataxin homologue gene (YFH1) showed a severe defect of mitochondrial respiration and loss of mtDNA associated with elevated intramitochondrial iron. Here we report in vivo evidence of impaired mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of FRDA patients. Using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated a maximum rate of muscle mitochondrial ATP production (V (max)) below the normal range in all 12 FRDA patients and a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial V (max) and the number of GAA repeats in the smaller allele.

Patients with familial APC (FAP) carry germ-line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life. The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation (genotype-phenotype correlation). Together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene, this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants. Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis. Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309. In contrast, mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis (codon 386 or 1465) interfered only weakly with wild-type APC activity.

By using transient and stable overexpression of human cDNAs encoding ALDP and its closest relative ALDRP, we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation in fibroblasts of X-ALD patients. The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X-ALD cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself. Moreover, we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP-deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate.

This study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with CHH and their first-degree relatives. STUDY DESIGN  One hundred twenty-two patients with CHH were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986. Their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the Population Register Center. This cohort underwent follow-up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 1995. RESULTS  A statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with CHH (standardized incidence ratio 6. 9, 95% confidence interval 2. 3 to 16), which was mainly attributable to non-Hodgkins lymphoma  (standardized incidence ratio 90, 95% confidence interval 18 to 264). In addition, a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen (standardized incidence ratio 35, 95% confidence interval 7. 2 to 102). The cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the Finnish population.

No C2 protein translation is detected in type I deficiency, while type II deficiency is characterized by a selective block in C2 secretion. Type I C2 deficiency was described in a family in which the C2 null allele (C2Q0) is associated with the major histocompatibility haplotype/complotype HLA-A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2; this extended haplotype occurs in over 90% of C2-deficient individuals (common complotype/haplotype). To determine the molecular basis of type I C2 deficiency, the C2 gene and cDNA were characterized from a homozygous type I C2-deficient individual with the common associated haplotype/complotype. We found a 28-base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene, beginning 9 base pairs upstream of the 3-end of exon 6, that generates a C2 transcript with a complete deletion of exon 6 (134 base pair) and a premature termination codon. In studies of eight kindred, the 28-base pair deletion was observed in all C2Q0 alleles associated with the common type I deficient complotype/haplotype; this deletion was not present in normal C2 nor in type II C2-deficient genes. These data demonstrate that  1) type I human complement C2 deficiency is caused by a 28-base pair genomic deletion that causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing, resulting in generation of a premature termination codon, 2) the 28-base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene is strongly associated with the HLA haplotype/complotype A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2, suggesting that all C2-deficient individuals with this haplotype/complotype will harbor the 28-base pair C2 gene deletion, and 3) type II C2 deficiency is caused by a different, as yet uncharacterized, molecular genetic

Relative to normal HDL, the cholesteryl esters are low, free cholesterol and phospholipids essentially normal, and triglycerides increased. The ratio of apoprotein (apo) to total cholesterol in the HDL of CTX was two to three times greater than normal. In the CTX HDL, the ratio of apoAI to apoAII was high, the proportion of apoC low, and a normally minor form of apoAI increased relative to other forms.

To determine whether PDS mutations in individuals with Pendred syndrome differ functionally from PDS mutations in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss, we compared three common Pendred syndrome allele variants (L236P, T416P and E384G), with three PDS mutations reported only in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss (V480D, V653A and I490L/G497S). The mutations associated with Pendred syndrome have complete loss of pendrin-induced chloride and iodide transport, while alleles unique to people with DFNB4 are able to transport both iodide and chloride, albeit at a much lower level than wild-type pendrin. We hypothesize that this residual level of anion transport is sufficient to eliminate or postpone the onset of goiter in individuals with DFNB4.

Because this gene is expressed in both rods and cones, mutations in the rds gene might be expected to cause degeneration affecting either the scotopic or photopic systems. Mutations at codon 172 of the rds gene have been identified in three families with autosomal dominantly inherited, progressive macular dystrophy. METHODS  Affected individuals underwent ophthalmic examination, scotopic perimetry, dark adaptometry, measurement of color-contrast sensitivity, and electroretinography to characterize the photoreceptor dysfunction. RESULTS  In all but one affected member, symptoms of progressive central visual loss developed in the third or fourth decade of life accompanied by central scotoma and well-demarcated atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris of the macula. In general, cone and rod thresholds were elevated, and color-contrast sensitivity was absent in the central visual field. Peripherally, the scotopic sensitivities were normal, as was the recovery from bleach. Cone electroretinograms were diminished in amplitude, and delayed in all affected adults except one. Rod electroretinograms were normal or near normal in amplitude, and had normal implicit times. Affected asymptomatic children had macular changes, abnormal color-contrast sensitivity, and reduced pattern and cone electroretinograms. CONCLUSION  These results indicate that mutations in the rds gene can be expressed as a macular dystrophy, with evidence of primary cone dysfunction and preservation of peripheral rod function.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 17, "DISEASE"], [70, 90, "DISEASE"], [141, 161, "DISEASE"], [244, 283, "DISEASE"], [584, 601, "DISEASE"], [892, 903, "DISEASE"], [967, 982, "DISEASE"], [1003, 1044, "DISEASE"], [1049, 1079, "DISEASE"], [1712, 1729, "DISEASE"], [1756, 1772, "DISEASE"]]}], ["In in-vivo experiments, BEA reduced the cell number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and other cells in mouse BALF.", {"entities": []}], ["Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by various types of cancer in childhood and adult cases.

On the other hand, hereditary mutations of TP57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A, which affect the cell cycle similar to TP53, were observed in some types of cancer. In a Turkish family with the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, we analyzed the mutation pattern of TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A in the peripheral blood, and loss of heterozygosity (homo/hemizygous deletion) pattern of TP53 and P15INK4B/P16INK4A in two tumor tissues. The propositus had a seminoma, his daughter a medulloblastoma, and one of his healthy cousins, a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation (AAA-- > ATA; Lys-- > Ile) in the peripheral blood cells. Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene. In the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter, a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation (GCG-- > GAG; Ala-- > Glu) was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation. P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. No other gene alteration in TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A was observed. Existence of the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene (seminoma/medulloblastoma) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis.

Analysis of mice homozygous for the mutant allele indicate that Brca1 is critical for normal development, as these mice died in utero between 10 and 13 days of gestation (E10-E13). Abnormalities in Brca1-deficient embryos were most evident in the neural tube, with 40% of the embryos presenting with varying degrees of spina bifida and anencephaly. In addition, the neuroepithelium in Brca1-deficient embryos appeared disorganized, with signs of both rapid proliferation and excessive cell death.. \n", {"entities": [[51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [51, 56, "GENE"], [150, 155, "GENE"], [307, 312, "GENE"], [366, 371, "GENE"], [393, 398, "GENE"], [514, 519, "GENE"], [653, 658, "GENE"], [725, 730, "GENE"], [803, 808, "GENE"], [937, 942, "GENE"], [1124, 1129, "GENE"], [0, 16, "DISEASE"], [34, 53, "DISEASE"], [71, 100, "DISEASE"], [106, 131, "DISEASE"], [370, 385, "DISEASE"], [418, 425, "DISEASE"], [511, 517, "DISEASE"], [709, 715, "DISEASE"], [1039, 1054, "DISEASE"], [1160, 1172, "DISEASE"], [1177, 1188, "DISEASE"], [1226, 1241, "DISEASE"]]}], ["They indicated that this situation is occurring because of several factors, such as the introduction of exotic species, pollution and urbanization, that have impacted the S\u00e3o Francisco River, resulting in a decline of fishing resources.", {"entities": []}], ["Considerable genetic heterogeneity in G6PD was found in the Bulgarian population-14 G6PD variants isolated from 117 hemizygous carriers of G6PD deficiency.

Repeats appeared to expand to a similar extent in tissues originating from the same embryonal origin. In most male patients carrying intermediate- or small-sized expansions in blood, the repeat lengths covered a markedly wider range in sperm. In contrast, male patients with large allele expansions in blood (> 700 CTGs) had similar or smaller repeats in sperm, when detectable. Sperm alleles with > 1, 000 CTGs were not seen. We conclude that DM patients can be considered gonosomal mosaics, i. e e., combined somatic and germ-line tissue mosaics. Most remarkably, we observed multiple cases where the length distributions of intermediate- or small-sized alleles in fathers sperm were significantly different from that in their offsprings blood. Our combined findings indicate that intergenerational length changes in the unstable CTG repeat are most likely to occur during early embryonic mitotic divisions in both somatic and germ-line tissue formation.

The segregation probability of mutant RB1 alleles in sperm samples was assessed by use of the SPERMSEG program, which includes experimental parameters, recombination fractions between the markers, and segregation parameters.

We detected a significant segregation distortion in the data as a whole (P =. 0099) and a significant heterogeneity in the segregation rate across donors (. 0092). Further analysis shows that this result can be explained by segregation distortion in favor of the normal allele in one donor only and that it does not provide evidence of a significant segregation distortion in the other donors. The segregation distortion favoring the mutant RB1 allele does not seem to occur during spermatogenesis, and, thus, meiotic drive may result either from various mechanisms, including a fertilization advantage or a better mobility in sperm bearing a mutant RB1 gene, or from the existence of a defectively imprinted gene located on the human X chromosome.\n", {"entities": [[523, 526, "GENE"], [567, 570, "GENE"], [1261, 1264, "GENE"], [1470, 1473, "GENE"], [523, 526, "GENE"], [567, 570, "GENE"], [1261, 1264, "GENE"], [1470, 1473, "GENE"], [523, 526, "GENE"], [567, 570, "GENE"], [1261, 1264, "GENE"], [1470, 1473, "GENE"], [523, 526, "GENE"], [567, 570, "GENE"], [1261, 1264, "GENE"], [1470, 1473, "GENE"], [47, 61, "DISEASE"], [106, 131, "DISEASE"], [229, 243, "DISEASE"], [433, 458, "DISEASE"], [605, 619, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tissue iron deposition secondary to excessive dietary iron absorption.

Using homologous recombination to disrupt the normal translation of ATP7B, we have generated a strain of mice that are homozygous mutants (null) for the Wilson disease gene. The ATP7B null mice display a gradual accumulation of hepatic copper that increases to a level 60-fold greater than normal by 5 months of age.

DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis, XY pseudohermaphroditism, and/or Wilms tumor (WT). DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1, which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) region. We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele, Wt1 (tmT396), which truncates ZF3 at codon 396, induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice. Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event, implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice. However, the mutant WT1 (tmT396) protein accounted for only 5% of WT1 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the WT.

Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries.

In this family of disorders, a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded, resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product. Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis; however, the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3, the disease protein in SCA3/MJD, adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells. The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine, but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a normal glutamine repeat. In addition, expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein, allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2. Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis, suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein (s) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain. This conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix. The pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix. These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain.. \n", {"entities": [[115, 144, "DISEASE"], [148, 170, "DISEASE"], [172, 176, "DISEASE"], [177, 180, "DISEASE"], [201, 233, "DISEASE"], [435, 456, "DISEASE"], [576, 596, "DISEASE"], [672, 676, "DISEASE"], [677, 680, "DISEASE"], [1648, 1652, "DISEASE"], [1653, 1656, "DISEASE"]]}], ["This study provides the first evidence of a relationship between gastrointestinal illness and estimates of fecal indicator organisms determined by qPCR at marine beaches.", {"entities": []}], ["Asthma was reported in 46% and allergic rhinitis in 40%.", {"entities": [[31, 48, "DISEASE"], [40, 48, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Blood for hormone analyses was collected routinely during the clinical visit.", {"entities": []}], ["Data on German asthma patients initiating treatment with budesonide/formoterol or salmeterol/fluticasone between June 2001 and June 2005 were obtained from the IMS Disease Analyzer database.", {"entities": [[15, 21, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Trough FEV 1 and FEV 1 area under the curve (AUC) (0-3h) responses were greater with each tiotropium Respimat\u00ae dose than with placebo (all P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and both were greatest with 5\u00a0\u03bcg.", {"entities": [[7, 10, "GENE"], [17, 20, "GENE"], [7, 10, "GENE"], [17, 20, "GENE"]]}], ["Chimeric transcription factors, created by gene fusions as the result of chromosomal translocations, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathologically disparate solid tumors.

Here we report that PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR display similar, but not identical transactivation activities when tested with model Pax recognition sequences. No functional role could be ascribed solely to the residual FKHR binding domain present in the fusion protein, but FKHR was found to contribute a strong carboxyl terminal activation domain replacing the one located in the unrearranged PAX3 gene. We show that the native PAX3/FKHR protein present in tumor cells with this translocation has transcriptional characteristics similar to the in vitro expressed protein.
